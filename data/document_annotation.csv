One of the early finds — a bell with the word Whydah etched into it — proved that the wreckage was Sam Bellamy’s pirate ship

A short movie introduces the former slave ship, which became a pirate ship in February 1717, when Bellamy captured it near the Bahamas.

The Whydah’s days of flying a Jolly Roger were numbered. On April 26, 1717, it sailed into a storm and sank, killing Bellamy and most of the crew.

The storm followed an unprecedented track, pushing westward across the New Jersey coast, delivering shock and awe from its enormous size and powerful weather impacts spanning 24 states.

Sandy can ultimately be traced to an African easterly wave, a pressure disturbance embedded in the benign trade winds. This wave intensified into a tropical depression on Oct. 22, 2012. Over the next two days, the depression became Tropical Storm Sandy (winds > 39 mph), then Hurricane Sandy (winds > 74 mph). These changes took place in the Caribbean, south of Cuba.

The hurricane is expected to become a tropic storm later today, but could still produce heavy rains that cause flash floods and mudslides, the center warned.

“Even though Patricia is weakening quickly, strong and damaging winds at higher elevations could persist through this morning,’’ the center’s 4 a.m. forecast said.

As a Category 5 storm, Patricia smashed Friday evening into Mexico’s south­western coast, a region best known for its beaches and the resort city of Puerto Vallarta. But it sidestepped any direct hits on the city and the major port city of Manzanillo, according to the Associated Press.Later, the hurricane center said it appeared that the storm had weakened somewhat while off the coast, to winds of 190 mph and then 160 mph.

At its peak, Patricia’s strength was off the charts at 8.3 on the 8.0 Dvorak storm intensity scale. Anything at 7.0 or above on the Dvorak scale is a Category 5 storm.The scene was calm, too, at a Red Cross shelter set up in an auditorium in Puetro Vallarta, where nearly 90 people waited for the storm.

“We have prepared a hot dinner — it’s not cold,” said Ali Nunez, a Red Cross medical worker, to ­illustrate the relaxed nature of emergency preparations. “I think people are a bit surprised about what they’ve heard about the hurricane.”

The Puerto Vallarta municipality is home to 255,000 people.

Patricia began taking shape late Wednesday, morphing with historic speed from a series of thunderstorms into an unprecedented hurricane. In little over a day, it went from a Category 1 hurricane to a Category 4, and soon hit the top of the scale.

Hurricane records are a little cloudy because similar storms in the western Pacific — called cyclones and typhoons — are not as closely monitored. But it appears that Patricia is a record-setter at 200 mph. In 2013, Super Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines with peak winds estimated at 195 mph.

August 29th is a date remembered on the northern Gulf Coast as the day Hurricane Katrina changed not only the lives of its inhabitants, but served as a pivotal moment in the history of the country.

But today, September 13th, is remembered by Texans as the day Hurricane Ike made landfall. Five years ago this morning, Ike came ashore in the Lone Star State, leaving in its wake one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history.

The strong Category 2 storm made a direct landfall in Galveston, Texas, at 2:10 a.m. CDT on September 13, 2008, bringing with it 110 mph sustained winds, over 18 inches of rain in some spots, and a storm surge that reached 20 feet deep along portions of the Texas coast.

Spatially, Ike was a massive storm. As the system neared landfall, Ike’s tropical storm force winds extended an incredible 275 miles away from its eye, and hurricane force winds extended upward of 120 miles from the eye. The immensity of the hurricane was also the main reason it was so damaging. Sustained winds between 80 and 90 mph impacted the densely-populated Galveston and Houston metropolitan areas for a longer period of time than one would normally find in a hurricane, causing additional stress to buildings and vegetation, and ultimately leading to more damage.

The large wind field was also to blame for Ike’s storm surge. As was the case with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (only a Category 3 at landfall) and Hurricane Sandy in 2012 (which was barely a hurricane when it struck New Jersey), the lateral extent of the high winds allowed Ike to shove a larger amount of seawater into the Texas coast than a strong Category 2 hurricane should if it were a more normal size. A surge between 10 and 20 feet deep tore through areas around Galveston Bay, pushing debris some 20 miles inland in spots. The surge washed out roadways and decimated other essential infrastructure (such as water and electricity), essentially cutting Galveston and surrounding areas off from the outside world for weeks and even months after the storm dissipated.

According to the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Ike was the third costliest hurricane in American history, behind Hurricanes Katrina (2005) and Sandy (2012), respectively, causing over $30 billion in damages in the United States alone. The economic damages only tell part of the story – the old adage that “material things can be replaced, but lives cannot” is why Ike is remembered so vividly by those who lived in its path.

Twenty people died along the Gulf Coast as a direct result of Ike’s winds and flooding, and even more died across the central and eastern United States as the storm’s remnants moved through and produced flash flooding. As a result of the Houston-Galveston area’s dense population (it was home to roughly six million people in 2012), human suffering was particularly amplified in areas that were hardest hit by the storm.

Thousands of families were left homeless after the storm damaged or destroyed their homes. Power outages affected nearly three million people at one point – some living without power for weeks on end. Portions of Galveston and Houston were not only left without power, but these power outages and damage to clean water infrastructure left some areas without running water for a period of time as well. Grocery stores experienced food shortages and gas stations experienced gas shortages. These humanitarian issues were compounded by the hot, humid weather that followed Ike, and brought about a level of human suffering, though temporary, not typically seen in a developed country.

Ike was one of the worst hurricanes to hit the United States, though it is often overshadowed in history as it happened in between Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. Today will be regarded by most as Friday the 13th, the superstitiously spooky day where bad things tend to happen. But for residents of Texas, this Friday the 13th is a reminder that bad events are very real.

By far the worst storm on record to hit Hawaii was Hurricane Iniki, which was a 145 mph Category 4 hurricane that crossed the island of Kauai on Sept. 10-11, 1992. It had formed in the eastern Pacific basin and was roughly 470 miles south-southeast of the state when it recurved toward the north to hit Kauai. It killed six people and destroyed more than 1400 houses and seriously damaged another 5,000. The damage was estimated at $2.3 billion in 1982 dollars.  Most of the damage was on Kauai, but Oahu also suffered serious damage.

Hawaii’s other damaging storms since 1950 are:

Hurricane Dot, which came from the east, hit Kauai on Aug. 6, 1959 with sustained winds as fast as 81 mph. At the time Kauai’s economy was based on farming, not today’s tourist resorts, homes, and condos. Dot did an estimated $6 million in damage to the sugar, macadamia nuts, and pineapple crops. Four days before Dot hit Hawaii an Air Force hurricane hunter airplane had reported its winds were 150 mph or faster. Hurricane hunters no longer routinely fly out of Hawaii.

Hurricane Nina, which didn’t directly hit Hawaii—its center passed 120 miles west of Kauai— produced 82 mph wind gusts in Honolulu on Dec. 1, 1957. Its heavy rain caused damage on Kauai and Oahu islands, but high surf on Kauai’s southern shore was blamed for most of the estimated $100,000 damage in 1957 dollars.

Hurricane Estelle formed in the eastern Pacific and on July 21, 1956. It was a Category 4 hurricane with 132 mph winds, when it was 900 miles southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. Fortunately, by the time its center passed 133 miles south of Hawaii’s southernmost point on July 23 its strongest winds had weakened 40 mph, barely a tropical storm. Nevertheless, by that time the 15- to 20-foot waves Estelle had generated were crashing into Hawaii’s southernmost “Big Island” and the island of Maui, destroying at least five houses and damaging others, causing $2 million in damage.

Hurricane Iwa, which hit Hawaii on November 23,1982 produced an estimated $234 million in damage, making it the state’s most expensive hurricane until Iniki hit 10 years later. Iwa heavily damaged the islands of Kauai, Oahu, and Niihau with wind gusts faster than 120 mph, 30-foot waves, and 8 feet of storm surge on the southern coast of Kauai even though its center passed 25 miles north of Kauai. While Iwa was blamed for only four deaths, it destroyed or seriously damaged 2,345 buildings, leaving 500 people homeless.

The U.K. ban applies to six countries, while the U.S. ban covers 10 airports in eight Muslim-majority countries.

The British ban also includes some cellphones and is expected to apply to all airports in the six nations.

The countries included in the British ban are Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia.

U.S. officials have been discussing whether to issue new security restrictions for some flights for the past two weeks, they said.

New limitations on carry-on items “are both an actual physical deterrent and an overall deterrent so the bad guys see this and say, ‘They’re onto us.’ That’s a win for the good guys,” Pistole said

The ban on liquids was implemented Aug. 10, 2006, after British and U.S. intelligence uncovered a plot to simultaneously blow up as many as 10 U.S.-bound passenger jets with liquid explosives hidden in carry-on luggage. Authorities arrested 24 suspects that day and launched new security measures that snarled air traffic. Travelers had to undergo special inspections after drinks and most other liquids and gels were banned as carry-on items (later rules allowed small amounts of liquids and gels, but with tight restrictions).

Under the restrictions, travelers to the United States from 10 mostly Middle Eastern airports will be required to put all personal electronic devices larger than a cellphone or smartphone in their checked baggage.

The airports are: Queen Alia International Airport (AMM) in Jordan, Cairo International Airport (CAI) in Egypt, Istanbul Ataturk Airport (IST) in Turkey, King Abdulaziz International Airport (JED) and King Khalid International Airport (RUH) in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait International Airport (KWI) in Kuwait, Mohammed V International Airport (CMN) in Morocco, Hamad International Airport (DOH) in Qatar, and Dubai International Airport (DXB) and Abu Dhabi International Airport (AUH) in the United Arab Emirates.

“IATA is working with its members and the TSA to achieve greater clarity on required actions,” the statement said.

6941,495,56de2d6c6b1ec7832960752d879cd98c,"Remembering Hurricane Isabel, 10 years later (PHOTOS)", hurricane damage,6,1,1,2,"On September 18, 2003, Hurricane Isabel made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane between Cape Lookout and Ocracoke Island in North Carolina with winds of 105 mph.  The storm tracked northwest through North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and into Pennsylvania, causing over $5 billion in damage.  The storm became extratropical over Pennsylvania and tracked into Canada.
Isabel was one of the most damaging storms to impact the Middle Atlantic States since Agnes in 1972 and Hazel in 1954.  Isabel was comparable to the great Potomac-Chesapeake Hurricane of 1933 in Virginia and Maryland regarding storm surge and damage to the coastline.

In the Washington area, Isabel caused severe tidal flooding and widespread tree damage.  Hundreds of thousands of people lost power and some areas were without power for over a week.  The tidal flooding in Washington, D.C. exceeded the record set by the Potomac-Chesapeake Hurricane of 1933.

Isabel in the Atlantic Ocean

Hurricane Isabel started as a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on September 1, 2003.  It struggled to develop for several days until it achieved tropical storm status on September 6.

The storm strengthened into a hurricane on September 7 and then it reached a rare Category 5 status with peak winds of 165 mph on September 11.  Hurricane Isabel’s strength fluctuated as it tracked east-northeast across the ocean and it achieved Category 5 status on three different occasions.

When Isabel approached the coast of North Carolina it encountered cooler waters, dry air and wind shear which helped to reduce its strength to a Category 2 hurricane.  The storm made landfall near Ocracoke Island as a Category 2 hurricane but it packed quite a punch for areas well inland from the coast.

Isabel in North Carolina

Hurricane Isabel slammed into the Outer Banks of North Carolina as a Category 2 hurricane.  Isabel produced extensive damage across eastern North Carolina.  The loss was in excess of $450 million.

The damage was heaviest along the coastline where the storm surge and strong winds damaged thousands of houses. During the storm, Hatteras Island in North Carolina was breached, creating an inlet that was later named, Isabel Inlet.  During the storm, over 700,000 residents lost power in North Carolina.

The tree damage and tree loss in eastern North Carolina was staggering.  In some areas near the Albemarle Sound, it appeared that one out of every two or three trees was blown down by the storm.

Isabel in Virginia

Governor Mark Warner stated that Isabel is “probably the worst storm in a generation.”  Most of the state experienced varying degrees of tree damage and the eastern portions of the state experienced record-breaking tidal flooding and damaging surf.

The damage at Colonial Beach was extremely bad and it rivaled the damage produced by Hurricane Hazel.  In Old Town Alexandria, the storm surge on the Potomac River topped the record set back in 1933 by the Potomac-Chesapeake Hurricane.  The flooding swamped the historic Torpedo Factory and many areas around King Street.  Along Alexandria’s waterfront, streets were navigated by canoe and kayak.

During the height of the storm, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge tunnel recorded a wind gust of 87 mph.  Norfolk recorded a peak wind gust of 83 mph and Quantico, Virginia recorded a gust of 78 mph. Rainfall was heaviest in western Virginia where Sherando, Virginia in Augusta County received over 20″.

In Northern Virginia, power outages were widespread.  In Fairfax County, the Fairfax County Water Authority lost power to four processing plants and many neighborhoods found that their taps ran dry for a day.

Isabel in Maryland

Tides ran five to eight feet above normal along the Chesapeake Bay which swamped Baltimore and Annapolis with record tides.  In Annapolis, the tide reached 7.58 feet above normal which broke the record set by the Hurricane of 1933.  At the United States Naval Acedemy, water filled hallways and classrooms.

Record tides flooded Baltimore’s Inner Harbor and historic Fells Point.  Clusters of condominiums and stores appeared to be islands surrounded by the water of the Chesapeake Bay.

Strong winds across much of the state of Maryland downed thousands of trees.  Patuxent Naval Air Station recorded a wind gust of 69 mph and Baltimore recorded a gust of 55 mph.  Hundreds of transformers (or transformer fuses) were witnessed to explode in the night sky with brilliant bursts of white, blue, and green light.

Isabel in Washington, D.C.

In Washington, the peak wind gust was recorded at 71 mph by the National Academy of Science. At Reagan National Airport, the peak wind gust reached 58 mph.

Within the city, over 1,500 trees fell, many landing on homes and cars.  At the White House, a tree fell in the front garden.

Tidal flooding occurred at the Washington Navy Yard and the water level reached a record 11.3 feet above normal at the Wisconsin Avenue gauge which exceeded the record set by the Hurricane of 1933.

My Isabel recollections

It was about 11 p.m. on September 18 when I started to hear the trees crashing to the ground near my Oakton, Virginia home.  The roar of the wind was unrelenting and about every 15 to 20 minutes I could hear a limb or tree snap. It reminded me of my childhood memory of Tropical Storm Agnes, but with many more snapping and crashing trees.

I knew that the loudest sounds of trees crashing to the ground were occurring directly in my yard.  I strained to look out the windows to see which trees had fallen.  There were limbs and branches strewn across the ground, but in the darkness, I could not discern individual trees.  The power was out and I chose to wait for morning to assess the damage.

When I finally went to sleep in the basement, I hoped that our family’s favorite tree, the rope swing tree, was still standing.  It was a favorite of the neighborhood.  The tree was located on a hill in my backyard, next to a small soccer field. It was used by many of the kids in the area.

In the light of morning, I surveyed the damage.  Three trees were on the ground in my yard and every road out of my neighborhood was blocked by fallen trees.

I quickly learned that our rope swing tree had fallen victim to Isabel’s winds.  I took some time to photograph my kids one last time with the swing and their favorite tree.

By mid-morning, some of my neighbors organized themselves into small groups with chain saws and they began to clear the neighborhood roads.

I was fortunate that I had two neighbors who helped me cut and remove the fallen trees that landed in my yard.

It took two days of hard work to cut up and clear the downed trees in my backyard.  We stacked rows of firewood along side of the road that seemed to span at least 50 yards.  The stacks of wood lasted for many weeks but eventually disappeared.

In my neighborhood, power was out for four days and the water was cut off for one day.  We lost most of our perishable food and we cooked with a propane grill.

Isabel was a very memorable experience, but not in a fun way like Snowmageddon.  I can handle another Snowmageddon but not another Isabel.  Once is enough.

What are your recollections of Isabel?

Hermine is set to end that streak., hurricane damage,6,1,0,2,"The National Hurricane Center announced on Thursday afternoon that Hermine, previously a tropical storm, attained hurricane intensity at 2:55 p.m. Eastern Thursday. At the same time, radar imagery revealed an eye emerging at the center of the storm, a telltale indicator that a hurricane was developing. Intense bands of wind and rain were already lashing Florida’s Gulf Coast from Tampa to Panama City.
As of 8 p.m., Hermine’s maximum sustained winds had increased to 80 mph and the storm was still strengthening. In less than 36 hours, the storm had intensified from a tropical depression with 35 mph winds to a hurricane whose winds could come close to 90 mph before landfall. Intensifying storms tend to inflict more damage at landfall than those that are weakening.

Just after 9 p.m., Apalachicola Airport posted a wind gust of 53 mph several hours ahead of when the worst winds were expected and the National Weather Service in Tallahassee said power outages were mounting in the region.

Florida has not experienced hurricane conditions since 2005 during Hurricane Wilma. In fact, the entire Gulf of Mexico hadn’t had a hurricane since Ingrid in 2013 – a period of almost three years – the longest on record.

A hurricane warning is in effect for a large portion of Florida’s Big Bend, which connects the panhandle and peninsula, from the Suwannee River to Mexico Beach along the Gulf Coast. The center of Hermine could make landfall anywhere between those locations around midnight. A dangerous storm surge is possible as the storm rolls ashore on Thursday night — particularly on the south side of the storm — and flooding will be exacerbated by heavy rain.

A storm surge warning is in effect from Franklin County through Hernando County. The highest surges are expected in coastal Wakulla, Jefferson and Taylor counties, and could reach 6 to 7 feet in the most vulnerable locations.

The timing of the tides will determine which locations get the worst impacts from storm surge.

Unlike Sandy in 2012, which arrived precisely at one of the highest astronomical tides of the year, Hermine should make landfall near low tide in Apalachicola, Fla., which reduces the net water level by about 1.2 feet. But in Cedar Key, roughly 150 miles farther down the coast, the storm is expected to make landfall closer to high tide when the water level is about 3.2 feet higher than at low tide.

Some of Apalachicola’s worst storm surge events include Hurricane Dennis in 2005 and Hurricane Elena in 1985, and Hermine’s surge could rival the surge produced by Category 3 Hurricane Dennis, which hit near Pensacola.

Another major threat facing north Florida and the Southeast United States in the coming hours and days is inland flooding caused by excessive rainfall. Through Sunday morning, a vast swath of the Big Bend and panhandle will get over six inches of rain. Some isolated areas could see more than 10 inches, especially where heavy rain bands form.

After passing over Florida, Hermine will track along the East Coast, bringing heavy rain to Georgia and the Carolinas. How far inland the storm tracks is still a question mark until the center passes through Florida and back over water in the Atlantic.

All landfalling tropical cyclones bring with them the risk of tornadoes. Hermine is no exception, and there is an elevated threat of tornadoes from the central Florida peninsula up into southeastern Georgia Thursday and Thursday night, including much of the Florida Panhandle. Tropical cyclone-induced tornadoes are generally not on the high end of the scale, but even EF-0 and EF-1 tornadoes are capable of causing damage to homes and trees.

Florida has not experienced hurricane conditions since Oct. 24, 2005, when Wilma hit near Naples as a Category 3 storm. As of Thursday, that is 3,965 days (10.9 years), a span that is nearly 1,800 days (4.9 years) longer than the previous “hurricane drought.” Note that the long-term average return period is just 507 days (1.4 years), or roughly five every seven years.",BASE_TIS,40.169447898864746,12.795490026474,27.220590829849243,408,957,40.01608085632324

The timing and therefore the location of the northward turn is still unclear. The GFS suggests the storm will begin to turn on Saturday in the central Caribbean, hitting Haiti on Sunday. The European model is forecasting the sharp turn later, by Monday, and therefore farther west in the Caribbean. In that scenario, it would hit Cuba on Tuesday.

Aid workers found vast numbers of damaged homes, as well as uprooted palm trees, toppled cellphone towers and downed power lines.

Two days after the hurricane slammed into the Western Hemisphere’s poorest nation with winds reaching 145 miles per hour, thousands of Haitians remained without power, communications or clean water. Aid groups warned that cholera could spread quickly, adding to the humanitarian crisis.

According to a Ministry of Interior spreadsheet available at a hurricane response coordinating meeting at the United Nations compound in Les Cayes, there have been at least 299 deaths just in parts of southern Haiti. Haiti’s interior minister, François Anick Joseph, had earlier said that at least 108 deaths were caused by the storm. At least four more deaths were reported in the neighboring Dominican Republic.

The town with the highest death toll on the document was Chantal, with 106 deaths, followed by Les Anglais, with 85. More than 35,000 people had taken refuge in shelters in the south, according to the document.

Other towns that were reportedly hard hit but which have been hard to reach, such as Jeremie, on the north side of the southern penninsula, had yet to be counted.

“That’s just the south, and that’s just what they know about,” said Conor Shapiro,35, who runs the St.Boniface Hospital in Fond des Blancs, the largest hospital on the southern peninsula.

Shapiro said that very few patients had been able to get to his hospital since the storm because roads are blocked and a key bridge washed out. He hoped to see more of an international rescue effort soon.

“Maybe the surge will come,” he said. “But this feels like a forgotten disaster.”

The hurricane, the most powerful Caribbean storm in nearly a decade, took aim at Florida on Thursday after carving a punishing path through the region, also striking Cuba and the Bahamas.

A helicopter tour Thursday of Les Cayes, a port city on Haiti’s southwestern coast, showed extensive damage, with cinder-block buildings knocked to the ground and metal roofs peeled back like tin can lids. Everywhere, trees were flattened, and the main river that runs through town was swollen to the top of its banks and running the color of milk chocolate.

Aid workers rushing to the scene to assess the damage feared that some towns were still cut off from the outside world, since bridges have been swept away and trees have fallen across rural roads. Thousands of people have been displaced.

“Flying over, we were able to see quite a lot of destruction. Storm surges, downed trees, crop damage, farm damage,” said Margaret Traub, head of global initiatives for International Medical Corps, who landed in Les Cayes with two colleagues and a journalist Thursday afternoon. “If I had to estimate, I would say at least 80 percent of buildings saw damage. Many of them were destroyed.”

Meanwhile, other alarming signs were emerging.

At least three cases of cholera were reported in Jeremie, on the tip of Haiti’s southwestern peninsula, said Holly Frew, a spokeswoman for the aid group CARE in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince. At a central hospital in Les Cayes, two people with cholera had shown up Thursday, but the hospital staff didn’t have the intravenous fluids or antibiotics to treat the disease.

Cholera, a potentially deadly disease spread by contaminated water, is a main concern for relief agencies struggling with how to bring clean water and emergency sanitation systems to areas now accessible only by air.

“This is a very great danger for the city,” said Tony Guillaume, an orthopedic surgeon in the hospital in Les Cayes. “They can contaminate others.”

Only one nurse was available to treat the crowd that showed up in one of the muddy hospital waiting rooms. Some sat waiting with broken limbs. A young man vomited on the floor. Some residents had cuts from metal roofing that blew off in the storm and sliced into people.

Doctors said they hoped to soon reopen the cholera ward, which had closed before the storm swept in, dumping waist-high water around the hospital.

Aerial images provided by the U.S. Coast Guard showed scenes of near-total damage in some areas: wooden homes now just scattered timbers, roofs sheared off and palm groves leveled by the Category 4 storm. In some areas of Haiti, people have been living in makeshift structures since a major earthquake six years ago that killed 200,000 people.

Haitian officials said 38 of the hurricane deaths occurred in the department of Grand Anse in the southwest of the country, which was especially hard hit.

About 80 percent of the buildings were destroyed in Jeremie, said Frew, the CARE spokes­woman.

The U.N. deputy special representative for Haiti, Mourad Wahba, has described the hurricane as the country’s worst humanitarian crisis since the earthquake in 2010.

Matthew slammed eastern Cuba before churning Thursday over the Bahamas, where residents were urged to move to high ground and the capital, Nassau, was battened down for the strongest hurricane in the Caribbean since Felix struck in 2007.

In Les Cayes, white United Nations trucks drove through the streets Thursday afternoon carrying heavy machinery, such as bulldozers and earthmovers, to serve the rescue and rebuilding efforts. Residents were out clearing away debris and beginning their repairs. Many roads were flooded, but some main thoroughfares were passable.

Across the hurricane-hit region, many Haitians sought shelter in schools where votes were meant to be cast on Sunday. Haiti’s electoral council on Wednesday postponed a presidential election that has already been delayed several times. Authorities said the situation would be evaluated over the next week before a new date was announced.

The U.S. Navy has sent three ships to Haiti, including an aircraft carrier and a hospital ship. About 300 Marines were aboard the USS Mesa Verde, an amphibious transport vessel.

The Haitian Embassy in Washington described the next few days as “critical to the recovery process” and urged governments, organizations and private individuals to coordinate their aid efforts to avoid overlap and waste.

“It is expected that many will want to engage and take initiatives toward recovery and relief efforts,” the statement said. “The state of Haiti strongly encourages all individuals who are in the process of organizing specific responses and action plans, to work with the local organizations and institutions in Haiti.”

A DHS official, who asked not to be identified because he’s not authorized to expand on the secretary’s statement, said the new measures would be phased in as quickly as possible.

They include expanded screening and other “seen and unseen” security measures.

6906,486,1e89945bc1d8eada86b11bb9e829f60c,Abolish the TSA, airport security procedures,5,1,1,2," CBS4 investigation has learned that two Transportation Security Administration screeners at Denver International Airport have been fired after they were discovered manipulating passenger screening systems to allow a male TSA employee to fondle the genital areas of attractive male passengers.
At the time, I was merely annoyed at the inconvenience, not to mention the poor performance of the taxpayer-funded $170,000 millimeter wave scanner that I had assumed was able to tell the difference between a brick of C-4 and genitals. It turns out those scanners have never stopped a terrorist, but maybe one day the TSA screeners will inadvertently catch a cute jihadist.

It’s a sign of just how resigned we’ve become to the TSA’s existence that most of the men getting felt up probably shrugged it off and thought, “Well, that’s the TSA for you.” We’ve become desensitized to being scanned and prodded and told our toothpaste is too large and must therefore be confiscated in the name of national security. TSA’s expansion of its PreCheck program and an announcement that it would stop searching black women’s hair for weapons are what pass for progress.

This is a raw deal. The federal government heaped a mountain of farcical security measures on the American public after 9/11, and now we’re supposed to give them a thumbs up for no longer taking nude photos of us and stealing pregnant ladies’ insulin.

Mind you, this is an agency that regularly employs kleptos and perverts, an agency that handed out security badges to criminals and on at least one occasion a dog. It does not hire the best and brightest, and those with any critical faculties understand that their job—confiscating snow globes and nail clippers—is a bad joke.

“Once, in 2008, I had to confiscate a bottle of alcohol from a group of Marines coming home from Afghanistan,” former TSA screener Jason Harrington wrote in Politico Magazine. “It was celebration champagne intended for one of the men in the group — a young, decorated soldier. He was in a wheelchair, both legs lost to an I.E.D., and it fell to me to tell this kid who would never walk again that his homecoming champagne had to be taken away in the name of national security.”

And yet the agency keeps finding new and innovative ways to expand its mission and waste money in the process. Since 2007, the TSA has deployed Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response (VIPR) squads. These roving VIPR teams, apparently named by an ‘80s action movie screenwriter, protect such homeland locations as bus stations, music festivals, trolleys, ports and rodeos. The program’s budget rose from $30 million in 2009 to more than $100 million by 2011, a pace that could be more accurately described as mission-jog than mission-creep.

Since 2007, the TSA has also spent more than $900 million on a behavior detection program that has never been independently verified by researchers to be effective. But it was hard to learn more about the program, since TSA kept the particulars of how it worked a closely guarded secret. (National security, naturally.) It was only until someone leaked documents to The Intercept that the public learned what the TSA was on the look out for. It turns out TSA behavior detection officers are trained to detect such suspicious actions as “exaggerated yawning,” “excessive complaints about the screening process,” and “face pale from recent shaving of beard,” among other signs.

The TSA also likes to try to hide how incompetent it is, but it’s bad at that, too. The agency has repeatedly over-classified reports to hide embarrassing failures from both congressional investigators and the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General. Several federal air marshal whistleblowers have also come forward corroborating these reports.

The agency’s proposed 2016 budget requests $7.35 billion in funding, a slight increase over the previous year but down from $7.8 billion in 2012. Things are moving in the right direction, but after a decade of security theater, how much longer should we be expected to tolerate it?

One way to speed up the process would be to go back to private screeners, like all airports in the U.S. used before 9/11 and many airports in Europe still use. U.S. airports are currently allowed to opt-out of using TSA screeners, and since a pilot program began in the early 2000s, the number of airports that have joined the TSA’s screening partnership program has risen from five to 21. Private screeners are more flexible, arguably more efficient according to TSA-haters in Congress, and certainly easier to oversee on an airport-by-airport basis than TSA’s unionized workforce of roughly 50,000 screeners.

Of course, privatized screeners are still under federal oversight and rules, which means the pat-downs and shoe-removal would continue, but at least TSA could focus more time on improving and streamlining its security procedures and less on catching employees filching laptops from passengers.

The end goal, obviously, should be to abolish the TSA. Barring that, let’s at least roll back the absurd security regulations to something that comports with reality—you know, the place where the bottle of booze in your carry-on isn’t a national security threat—and reduce the agency to a small group of inspectors with clipboards who make sure that rules are being followed.

The current, bloated TSA is a malignant lump on the federal bureaucracy, an embarrassing but persistent leftover of our post-9/11 mindset. Plagued by low morale and poor performance, the TSA will become harder dislodge every year it remains in existence. As a wise prophet from Nazareth once said, “if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away.” Considering where the TSA’s hands have been lately, it’s about time we lopped it off from the body politic.

Position: Federal security director, Transportation Security Administration, Department of Homeland Security

Best known for: Most people think of airport security as a walk through the metal detector and the eyeballing of passengers and their possessions by transportation security officers. Liddell, whose job is to protect the flying public at seven airports in central New York, sees the role of a security officer as far more complex.
Security officers are tested covertly. A banned item will be sent through a checkpoint and the reaction is monitored. Everyone at that checkpoint then participates in an “after-action” review. From there, problems are analyzed and employees can be given additional training.
Liddell understands that airport security personnel perform multiple tasks under constant camera surveillance and public scrutiny, often interacting with tired or irritated travelers. But he said that he thinks the testing and training help security officers stay sharp.

But the L’Enfant Plaza incident exposed serious gaps in crisis reaction, some of which were similar to those in previous incidents. 

The faulty alarm system appears to be one example of money that was wasted. Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said that a system was installed for about $2 million but that it did not produce reliable results and required extraordinary efforts to maintain.

As a result, Stessel said, Metro never advised the fire departments that the monitoring system had been activated in the first place.

The episode was an example of what Prince George’s County Fire Chief Marc S. Bashoor, chairman of the region’s fire chiefs committee, called Metro’s record of “lack of transparent cooperation.”

In the Yellow Line accident, federal safety investigators cited Metro’s lack of written guidelines and proper training in concluding that the transit system mishandled ventilation fans that could have cleared smoke from the tunnel.

The reason, in a word: Brussels.

A plane carrying Transportation Security Administration head Peter Neffenger was nosing up to an arrival gate in Brussels on March 22 when the first of two bombs that killed 16 people exploded in the terminal. A third went off a short time later in a subway, also killing 16.

The Senate, eager to act after the bombings, voted Thursday to increase the vetting of airport workers, expand the number of TSA viper teams that sweep through airports unannounced to stop and search suspicious people, and double the number of TSA’s bomb-sniffing dogs.
Neffenger said that travelers will see a much more visible police presence at airports in the months to come and an increase in bomb-sniffing dogs as rapidly as they can be trained. He said passengers should expect more random searches as they enter airports and after they pass through checkpoints into secure boarding areas.

One step Neffenger took last year already has intensified security closer to the boarding gate. He ended a practice under which passengers in what’s known as a “standard” line at checkpoints were randomly selected to go through an expedited line normally reserved for those who have gone through federal background-check programs, such as PreCheck or Global Entry.

TSA has 320 trained dogs, and local law enforcement agencies have committed almost 700 more to patrol airports. Most are trained to detect bombs in checked luggage. Neffenger is having all of the TSA dogs cross-trained so they can work passenger lines.

“TSA increased the random and unpredictable screening of aviation workers at various airport access points to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities,” Johnson said in his announcement.

Johnson said he had asked the TSA’s Aviation Security Advisory Committee to review the incidents and recommend remedies. Acting on five of the recommendations that can be implemented quickly, Johnson said that airport and airline employees who are traveling as passengers would no longer be permitted to bypass the scrutiny faced by other passengers. Anyone who boards an airplane other than on-duty pilots and crew will be screened, he said.

Airports will also be required to reduce the number of access points to secure areas and to subject airport workers to random screening throughout each workday, he said, adding that the TSA may send teams in unannounced to do random worker screens. Johnson also said the TSA is working with the FBI to continuously track the criminal histories of all aviation workers.

“By dialing up the random screening we increase the sense among employees that their bags may be checked,” Hatfield said.

the TSA also will require the federal officials who supervise airport security to develop plans for stricter aviation worker screening at each airport. Some airport workers will receive additional training in how to spot suspicious behavior by their colleagues.

Applicants for airport or airline jobs already face several types of screening. They are checked for criminal records; their immigration status is reviewed; and they are checked against the terrorist-screening database.

After the arrest in Atlanta, the airport reprogrammed all of the badges that allowed access to secure areas.

According to the FTA, the operations supervisor on duty conducted only a “cursory inspection before ordering the damaged track back into service.”

The controllers cut the power only after a second smoke event in the same station later that day.

The second incident was caused by debris cluttered around the electrified third rail. The smoke prompted the evacuation of the Federal Center SW station and the suspension of service on portions of three lines.

●First, Metro “failed to notify FTA of the event in accordance with established protocol.”

●Second, a Metro operations supervisor at the scene “conducted only a cursory inspection before ordering the damaged track back into service.”

●The Rail Operations Control Center, or ROCC, denied permission to Metro maintenance personnel when they requested permission to take the track out of service and remove power from the third rail so appropriate inspections could be performed.

●Finally, the ROCC “did not give [Metro] investigators clearance to proceed with the inspections until several hours later.”

Metro closed that portion of the Blue, Orange and Silver lines only after the second fire-and-smoke incident occurred at the same station later in the day, the FTA said.

But the experts confirmed several shortcomings that were brought to light by the fatal incident — notably Metro’s inadequate tunnel ventilation processes, which were controlled Jan. 12 by ROCC employees who seemed ill-prepared for the task.

The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the Jan. 12 incident, has said that Metro botched the operation of ventilation fans while a Yellow Line train loaded with passengers was stuck in a smoke-filled tunnel near the L’Enfant Plaza station. The noxious fumes sickened scores of riders, one of whom died.

In addition, some of the six fans malfunctioned during the incident, which the safety board said was caused by an electrical problem on the tunnel tracks.

In terms of air-moving capacity and operational sophistication, much of Metro’s tunnel ventilation infrastructure falls short of modern standards, having been built decades ago, the report said.

That’s when the crew noticed a blip on the ship’s radar. It was approaching. Fast. It could be only one thing: pirates.

An hour after the blip appeared, the ship’s 43-year-old chief engineer, Oleg Dereglazov, turned to the stern and spotted a small skiff loaded with six men, all carrying rifles. The skiff, pounding through the waves at 20 knots, was gaining on the lumbering tanker. The pirates fired a rocket-propelled grenade that arced over the Marida Marguerite, then another. If one of the rockets hit the vessel and its volatile cargo, Dereglazov later recalled, “there would be no ship nor pirates.”

The ship slowed, and a sailor threw a ladder over its starboard side. The mariners watched as the six Somali pirates, armed with AK-47s, stepped onto the deck and headed straight for the bridge, where they ordered the captain to sail toward Somali waters. He refused. A pirate took off the captain’s glasses and slapped him hard across the face, making the demand plain: Comply, Makane testified, or be “physically abused.”

So what, exactly, is the TSA doing differently? It’s difficult to quantify, and security concerns prevent the agency from providing specifics. The number of air travelers who receive pat-downs is fairly low. Only those who have opted opt out of using full-body scanners or whose belongings have set off the X-ray machine are required to undergo the pat-downs. Travelers may also be frisked at random, as part of the agency’s “unpredictable” security measures.

The new pat-down was developed in response to a Department of Homeland Security Office Inspector General assessment conducted last year, which found widespread failures in the TSA’s technology, procedures and agent performance. In response, the TSA pledged to improve its manual screening protocol, among other measures.

It packed winds of up to 145 mph when it swept over Haiti on Tuesday and then hit Cuba and the Bahamas. A slightly weakened Matthew was expected to make landfall in Florida on Thursday.

John Hasse, national director of the aid group World Vision in Haiti, estimated “thousands of houses destroyed or damaged” in the areas hardest hit. The Haitian government said at least 350,000 people were in need of immediate help around the country, the United Nations said. At the same time, fears rose of possible outbreaks of cholera or other diseases.

As for ventilation problems, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) and Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) said the group was told that after the six-car train encountered smoke in the tunnel and abruptly stopped just south of the L’Enfant Plaza station, the train’s air-intake system was not turned off, meaning it drew smoke into the cars.

As a result, the mass of fumes settled over the stationary train and stayed there.

If the fans had been properly coordinated, creating brisk air circulation, the smoke would have been expelled from the tunnel, the NTSB saidAt 3:15 p.m. Jan. 12, moments after southbound train No. 302 departed the L’Enfant Plaza station, it encountered smoke in the Yellow Line tunnel and stopped, according to the NTSB. Much more smoke was ahead, the result of an electrical malfunction on the tracks about 1,100 feet in front of the train’s lead car.The critical problem was the absence of air circulation, Hart said.The smoke did not pass over the train and flow entirely into the station because it began to be pulled from the other direction by the fans in the vent shaft. “You need a push and a pull,” Hart said at the COG meeting.Hart said: “NTSB investigators found during post-accident inspection that two of the four [shaft] fan. . . . were non-operational.”

It had formed in the eastern Pacific basin and was roughly 470 miles south-southeast of the state when it recurved toward the north to hit Kauai. It killed six people and destroyed more than 1400 houses and seriously damaged another 5,000. The damage was estimated at $2.3 billion in 1982 dollars.  Most of the damage was on Kauai, but Oahu also suffered serious damage.
Hurricane Dot, which came from the east, hit Kauai on Aug. 6, 1959 with sustained winds as fast as 81 mph. At the time Kauai’s economy was based on farming, not today’s tourist resorts, homes, and condos. Dot did an estimated $6 million in damage to the sugar, macadamia nuts, and pineapple crops. Four days before Dot hit Hawaii an Air Force hurricane hunter airplane had reported its winds were 150 mph or faster. Hurricane hunters no longer routinely fly out of Hawaii.

Hurricane Nina, which didn’t directly hit Hawaii—its center passed 120 miles west of Kauai— produced 82 mph wind gusts in Honolulu on Dec. 1, 1957. Its heavy rain caused damage on Kauai and Oahu islands, but high surf on Kauai’s southern shore was blamed for most of the estimated $100,000 damage in 1957 dollars.

Hurricane Estelle formed in the eastern Pacific and on July 21, 1956. It was a Category 4 hurricane with 132 mph winds, when it was 900 miles southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. Fortunately, by the time its center passed 133 miles south of Hawaii’s southernmost point on July 23 its strongest winds had weakened 40 mph, barely a tropical storm. Nevertheless, by that time the 15- to 20-foot waves Estelle had generated were crashing into Hawaii’s southernmost “Big Island” and the island of Maui, destroying at least five houses and damaging others, causing $2 million in damage.

Hurricane Iwa, which hit Hawaii on November 23,1982 produced an estimated $234 million in damage, making it the state’s most expensive hurricane until Iniki hit 10 years later. Iwa heavily damaged the islands of Kauai, Oahu, and Niihau with wind gusts faster than 120 mph, 30-foot waves, and 8 feet of storm surge on the southern coast of Kauai even though its center passed 25 miles north of Kauai. While Iwa was blamed for only four deaths, it destroyed or seriously damaged 2,345 buildings, leaving 500 people homeless. Damages were estimated at $312 million in 1982 dollars.

• If you're silly enough to have brought along more than 3 ounces of toothpaste, shampoo, liquor, water or some other liquid on your flight, you're going to have to either toss it or start the whole process over again. If, say, a friend or family member gives you a bottle of bourbon that consequently has sentimental value, you're going to have to pay $29 or whatever to check your bag or else watch a TSA inspector pour out the memories before your very eyes.

• At the end of the security line wait, you have to take off your shoes, jacket and belt, empty your pockets, pull your laptop and/or liquids (3 ounces or less!) out of your carry-on bag, and arrange all those into separate bins (one for the laptop alone, of course!). I usually expedite this process while waiting in line -- taking off my belt and emptying my pockets and putting the contents into my carry-on bag, taking out my laptop and holding it separately, and unlacing my shoes, though on at least one occasion this has ended with me tripping on my shoelaces, with hijinks ensuing.

• Once you've managed all that, you get to go through a metal detector or, better yet, a body scanner -- for looking under your clothes. While the infamously invasive Rapiscan scanner was phased out over inadequate privacy protections, body scanners generally aren't going anywhere.
Usually that's it, but sometimes you're randomly selected for a pat-down. And if they find something they don't like in your luggage or on your person, you could get even more than that. Hooray!

Pistole’s drive to lessen the burden and focus on average passengers so that security workers can spend more time looking for people who pose a genuine threat. Travelers who use the TSA’s Pre-Check program can keep their shoes, belts and sweaters on and do not have to pull their laptops from cases or display their bags of liquids in special airport checkpoint lines. Their carry-on luggage will still pass through X-ray machines, and they still must step through metal detectors.

Enrollment in the program begins online. Then applicants will need to spend about 10 minutes (not counting any wait time) at an enrollment center signing up for the program, the TSA said. The program requires a background check, fingerprints and an $85 fee for a five-year enrollment. A passport, required for some other programs, is not necessary, but verification of identity and citizenship or approved immigrant status is needed.

More than 25 million fliers have used the security program since its soft rollout in 2011, according to the TSA. Once an application is approved, passengers will receive a Known Traveler Number, which makes them eligible to use expedited security lines in more than 100 airports and on nine airlines: Alaska, American, Delta, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Southwest, United, US Airways and Virgin America.",BASE_TIS,40.38190984725952,10.728278875350952,29.36300015449524,341,933,40.09127902984619

Johnson said the agency is expediting the hiring process to bring in  additional officers by June 15. Those new staff will be in addition to 576 TSA officers added this year, he said.

The agency further plans to beef up checkpoint staffing by maximizing the use of overtime, using $34 million in additional funds already approved by Congress. Johnson said the agency will also deploy more bomb-sniffing dogs and shift additional TSA staff from other jobs into screening lines. The TSA is also working with airlines to reduce the size of carry-on luggage and their number.

Johnson also said the agency is “doubling down” on research for more technology and innovation to help screen passengers and luggage.  And he said both the federal government and the airlines were teaming up to market TSA’s PreCheck program; he said the government was also encouraging businesses to reimburse their employees for the enrollment fee.

When one of the destroyers neared the 58-foot sailing boat, gunfire erupted. By the time Navy SEALs reached the Quest, the four Americans had been fatally shot — the first time U.S. citizens were killed in a wave of piracy that has rippled out from the coast of Somalia in recent years.

On Tuesday, a federal court in Virginia will begin jury selection in the capital trial of three Somali pirates charged in the February 2011 deaths of Scott and Jean Adam of Marina del Rey, Calif., and Bob Riggle and Phyllis Macay of Seattle.

Nearly two dozen pirates have been convicted in U.S. courts in connection with the seizure of foreign vessels, but the trial in Norfolk marks the first death penalty case brought against pirates in the United States. The case is part of a multinational legal crackdown that has led to the prosecution of Somali pirates in 20 countries.

Meanwhile, about 1,200 pirates have been arrested overseas, and a significant number of them have been prosecuted in countries close to Somalia, including Kenya and the Seychelles. At one point last year, about 20 percent of the prison population in the Seychelles was Somali pirates, according to officials in the archipelago nation. As Somalia stabilizes, an international contact group on Somali piracy is developing plans to allow pirates to be prosecuted and serve their time in their home country.

As the final two pirates stepped from the deck of the Marida Marguerite, one turned to address the crew. He was Mohammad Shibin, a smooth-talking, English-speaking Somali who had acted as the pirates’ negotiator with the German shipping company. He had also helped keep the crew in line, often brutally.

But the case highlights what federal authorities say is the important and little-known role that negotiators such as Shibin play in Somali piracy, which has received international attention in recent years. A U.N. Security Council report in July said that such piracy remains a “threat to global shipping” and a “humanitarian tragedy for hijacked seafarers and kidnapped hostages.”

Although hijackings have declined in the past year or so because of stepped-up security precautions, attempted hijackings by Somali pirates are on the rise, international authorities say. This year, Somali pirates have successfully hijacked 13 ships and continue to hold more than 180 hostages.

A third went off a short time later in a subway, also killing 16.

Expected to pass through airports in near-record numbers this summer, Americans can expect to be sniffed by more dogs, scrutinized by more armed police officers and faced with longer security lines.

“There’s a lot more patrolling of public areas here than I believe was the case in Brussels. We have explosive-sniffing dogs moving through the fronts of the big airports. And there’s a lot of attention paid to people moving big items through airports.”

""If you’ve made a reservation, your name is automatically bounced against databases.”

Neffenger said that travelers will see a much more visible police presence at airports in the months to come and an increase in bomb-sniffing dogs as rapidly as they can be trained. He said passengers should expect more random searches as they enter airports and after they pass through checkpoints into secure boarding areas.

One step Neffenger took last year already has intensified security closer to the boarding gate. He ended a practice under which passengers in what’s known as a “standard” line at checkpoints were randomly selected to go through an expedited line normally reserved for those who have gone through federal background-check programs, such as PreCheck or Global Entry.

But he says he has an antidote to that problem: more bomb-sniffing dogs working the passenger lines.

TSA has 320 trained dogs, and local law enforcement agencies have committed almost 700 more to patrol airports. Most are trained to detect bombs in checked luggage. Neffenger is having all of the TSA dogs cross-trained so they can work passenger lines.

“They are the ones that are designed to walk up and down a security line and detect for explosive vapor wake, and then they trace it back to its source,” he said.

“Immediately following the incident” with the Delta baggage handler, “TSA increased the random and unpredictable screening of aviation workers at various airport access points to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities,” Johnson said in his announcement.
TSA’s Aviation Security Advisory Committee to review the incidents and recommend remedies. Acting on five of the recommendations that can be implemented quickly, Johnson said that airport and airline employees who are traveling as passengers would no longer be permitted to bypass the scrutiny faced by other passengers. Anyone who boards an airplane other than on-duty pilots and crew will be screened, he said.
Airports will also be required to reduce the number of access points to secure areas and to subject airport workers to random screening throughout each workday, he said.
At least two Atlanta airport workers allegedly conspired to smuggle guns and ammunition onto at least 20 flights bound for New York between May and December of last year.
The arrest warrant affidavit for Eugene Harvey, identified as a Delta baggage handler, said Harvey used his security clearance to funnel guns to a passenger named Mark Henry after Henry had cleared security. Henry, identified as a former employee, allegedly carried the weapons on at least 20 flights to New York.
Hatfield, in an interview Monday, said that random screenings at employee access points will deter wrongdoing. “By dialing up the random screening we increase the sense among employees that their bags may be checked,”
he TSA also will require the federal officials who supervise airport security to develop plans for stricter aviation worker screening at each airport. Some airport workers will receive additional training in how to spot suspicious behavior by their colleagues.
The TSA conducts annual inspections of security at all commercial airports.
After the arrest in Atlanta, the airport reprogrammed all of the badges that allowed access to secure areas.

Five years ago this morning, Ike came ashore in the Lone Star State, leaving in its wake one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history.

The strong Category 2 storm made a direct landfall in Galveston, Texas, at 2:10 a.m. CDT on September 13, 2008, bringing with it 110 mph sustained winds, over 18 inches of rain in some spots, and a storm surge that reached 20 feet deep along portions of the Texas coast.

Spatially, Ike was a massive storm. As the system neared landfall, Ike’s tropical storm force winds extended an incredible 275 miles away from its eye, and hurricane force winds extended upward of 120 miles from the eye. The immensity of the hurricane was also the main reason it was so damaging. Sustained winds between 80 and 90 mph impacted the densely-populated Galveston and Houston metropolitan areas for a longer period of time than one would normally find in a hurricane, causing additional stress to buildings and vegetation, and ultimately leading to more damage.
According to the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Ike was the third costliest hurricane in American history, behind Hurricanes Katrina (2005) and Sandy (2012), respectively, causing over $30 billion in damages in the United States alone. The economic damages only tell part of the story – the old adage that “material things can be replaced, but lives cannot” is why Ike is remembered so vividly by those who lived in its path.

Twenty people died along the Gulf Coast as a direct result of Ike’s winds and flooding, and even more died across the central and eastern United States as the storm’s remnants moved through and produced flash flooding. As a result of the Houston-Galveston area’s dense population (it was home to roughly six million people in 2012), human suffering was particularly amplified in areas that were hardest hit by the storm.

This storm missed the U.S. but hit Newfoundland, Canada on Aug. 26. It killed at least 223 people, mostly on ships at sea.
Reports from the Bahamas helped the Weather Bureau forecast the hurricane that hit New York City on Aug. 24, 1893. This storm did extensive damage around the city, sinking ships and boats offshore. In fact after 1893 no storm caused more damage to New York City until Sandy last year. Nevertheless, these forecasts had major shortcomings.
Unknown to them, a tropical storm in the southern Bahamas, between reporting stations in Nassau and Cuba was quickly growing into a major hurricane. By Monday, the Weather Bureau’s Jacksonville, Fla. office, which handled hurricane forecasting, was receiving reports from ships as well as weather stations in the Bahamas and Florida that led forecasters to send out a bulletin that a weak hurricane was approaching the Keys. That evening the strongest hurricane ever to hit the United States swept across the Keys roughly halfway between Key West and Miami with 185 mph winds and a central pressure of 26.34 inches of mercury.

It’s one of the three Category 5 storms to hit the U.S.  The others were Camille, which hit Mississippi in 1969, and Andrew, which hit Dade County, Fla. in 1992.

And that’s the suggestion by Donald Trump that if he were elected president he would consider ordering the removal of Muslim women who wear hijabs from the TSA. That idea came from a Trump supporter during a New Hampshire campaign event, and the Republican Party’s presumptive presidential nominee seemed to agree — and that’s just so wrong in so many ways that it doesn’t bear repeating further.

The storm became extratropical over Pennsylvania and tracked into Canada.

Isabel was one of the most damaging storms to impact the Middle Atlantic States since Agnes in 1972 and Hazel in 1954.  Isabel was comparable to the great Potomac-Chesapeake Hurricane of 1933 in Virginia and Maryland regarding storm surge and damage to the coastline.

In the Washington area, Isabel caused severe tidal flooding and widespread tree damage.  Hundreds of thousands of people lost power and some areas were without power for over a week.  The tidal flooding in Washington, D.C. exceeded the record set by the Potomac-Chesapeake Hurricane of 1933.

Hurricane Isabel slammed into the Outer Banks of North Carolina as a Category 2 hurricane.  Isabel produced extensive damage across eastern North Carolina.  The loss was in excess of $450 million.

The damage was heaviest along the coastline where the storm surge and strong winds damaged thousands of houses. During the storm, Hatteras Island in North Carolina was breached, creating an inlet that was later named, Isabel Inlet.  During the storm, over 700,000 residents lost power in North Carolina.

The tree damage and tree loss in eastern North Carolina was staggering.  In some areas near the Albemarle Sound, it appeared that one out of every two or three trees was blown down by the storm.

The Transportation Security Administration is imposing more stringent regulations for screening airport and airline workers, four months after federal authorities discovered that a Delta Air Lines baggage handler allegedly was part of a ring that smuggled guns from Atlanta to New York.

Announced Monday by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, the rules also come in reaction to a separate incident in which a Federal Aviation Administration employee allegedly used a badge to access a secure area at the same airport — Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport — and then flew to New York with a gun in his carry-on luggage.


“Immediately following the incident” with the Delta baggage handler, “TSA increased the random and unpredictable screening of aviation workers at various airport access points to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities,” Johnson said in his announcement.

Airports will also be required to reduce the number of access points to secure areas and to subject airport workers to random screening throughout each workday, he said, adding that the TSA may send teams in unannounced to do random worker screens. Johnson also said the TSA is working with the FBI to continuously track the criminal histories of all aviation workers.

Fliers can still travel with these items, but they must be packed in their checked baggage on U.S.- and U.K.-bound flights from airports across the countries, including busy hubs in Istanbul, Dubai and Doha, Qatar.
he U.S. restrictions were prompted by a growing concern within the government that terrorists who have long sought to develop hard-to-detect bombs hidden inside electronic devices may have put renewed effort into that work.
Officials have said that in 2014, U.S. authorities were increasingly worried that suspected bombmaker Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, who was allegedly instrumental to al-Qaeda’s Yemen branch in several bomb plots, might be helping terrorists in Syria develop new, harder-to-detect explosive devices.
New limitations on carry-on items “are both an actual physical deterrent and an overall deterrent so the bad guys see this and say, ‘They’re onto us.’ That’s a win for the good guys,” Pistole said, “because then you have time to push the terrorists off to another location, another time, another type of attack. It gives law enforcement and security services more opportunity to identify and disrupt plots.”
The ban on liquids was implemented Aug. 10, 2006, after British and U.S. intelligence uncovered a plot to simultaneously blow up as many as 10 U.S.-bound passenger jets with liquid explosives hidden in carry-on luggage. Authorities arrested 24 suspects that day and launched new security measures that snarled air traffic.
ravelers had to undergo special inspections after drinks and most other liquids and gels were banned as carry-on items (later rules allowed small amounts of liquids and gels, but with tight restrictions).
The decision to announce the British ban was made during a meeting on aviation security measures Tuesday by British Prime Minister Theresa May, who had chaired similar meetings over the past few weeks. 
Under the restrictions, travelers to the United States from 10 mostly Middle Eastern airports will be required to put all personal electronic devices larger than a cellphone or smartphone in their checked baggage. U.S. airlines are not affected by the ban because none offer direct U.S.-bound flights from the affected airports.
Ten airports in eight countries — Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — are affected. Officials said the airports were selected based on the “current threat picture.”

In its most detailed revelations yet about the Jan. 12 incident, the National Transportation Safety Board outlined a sequence of missteps in which Metro controllers, 11 miles from the scene, activated two sets of giant fans at cross-purposes with devastating consequences.

The two sets of fans, on opposite ends of the train, were both pulling the smoke instead of one set pushing while the other pulled, the NTSB said. As a result, the mass of fumes settled over the stationary train and stayed there.
Making matters worse Jan. 12, Hart said, “the train ventilation system that draws air from the outside into the cars was not shut off by the train operator.” After the Yellow Line train stopped in the tunnel, the surrounding smoke permeated the six cars largely because it was pulled in by the train’s heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system.
At 3:15 p.m. Jan. 12, moments after southbound train No. 302 departed the L’Enfant Plaza station, it encountered smoke in the Yellow Line tunnel and stopped, according to the NTSB. Much more smoke was ahead, the result of an electrical malfunction on the tracks about 1,100 feet in front of the train’s lead car.

At 3:16 p.m., Hart said, Metro controllers in Landover reacted to the train operator’s report of smoke by turning on giant fans inside the L’Enfant Plaza station — behind the stationary train in the tunnel. The fans were activated in “exhaust mode,” Hart said, meaning they were sucking massive volumes of air in the direction of the station.
Then, at 3:24 p.m., according to Hart, the Landover controllers switched on another set of fans — inside a huge ventilation shaft about 1,100 feet in front of the train, near the source of the smoke. The shaft rises from the tunnel to the street.",BASE_WAPO,67.27749490737915,10.405610084533691,56.70270490646362,363,916,67.10831499099731

The airports with the most firearm interceptions were Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (153); Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (144); Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport (100); Denver International Airport (90); and Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (73).
Those who bring firearms to the security checkpoints or fail to declare them in checked luggage can run afoul of criminal and civil charges.
TSA on Thursday also offered a rundown on the scope of its monitoring, saying that more than 708 million passengers underwent screening in 2015. That was up 40.7 million, or nearly 6 percent from the previous year.
One passenger at the Orlando International Airport “concealed two handguns, one unassembled rifle, and an unidentified amount of ammunition inside three amplifiers in a checked bag,” TSA said.

According to Suckling, pirates did not disappear. Rather, they shifted their focus to other illicit activities, such as arms trafficking to Yemen. One theory, he said, is that a clan opposed to the president of Somalia's Puntland region encouraged the attack on the Aris 13 to promote the idea that the area is poorly governed.
The Aris 13 wasn't a fishing vessel, but Somali fishermen have suggested that abducting its crew could be an effective way to bring attention to their complaints and deter foreign fishing boats.

At first the penalty was a mandatory minimum of death: in the late 1800s Congress set it to life at hard labor, and then in 1909 to life. Last week, a U.S. District Court judge found it unconstitutional as applied to some Somali pirates, in United States v. Said. As I mentioned earlier, I think the result is wrong, and will outline some problems with the opinion, in no particular order.

Judge Jackson thinks that under the Eighth Amendment, a mandatory life sentence is “grossly disproportionate” as applied to the current defendants, because while they did attack a U.S. Navy destroyer (in the mistaken belief it was a merchant ship) with rifles and RPGs, they were wildly unsuccessful, and did not manage to hurt anyone. Judge Jackson argues that attempts are typically treated differently from completed offenses in federal law. But in all the examples he sites, the statutes defining the primary conduct explicitly treat attempt as a lesser offense.

The 50-year-old former teacher — who learned English at school in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, is a father of five and once worked as an oil company dispatcher — was convicted of piracy and hostage-taking on the Marida Marguerite and the Quest. He was sentenced in August to life in prison. His court-appointed attorney, James O. Broccoletti, who argued that Shibin was nothing more than a humanitarian intermediary, is appealing the verdict.

Six men in a small boat

Shibin’s trial, which included testimony from crew members of the Marida Marguerite, fellow pirates and federal agents, as well as the playing of audio recordings of his negotiations, provided a rare account of a negotiator’s work and the gruesome day-to-day life aboard a pirated ship.

The hijacking of the Marida Marguerite began May 8, 2010, in the Gulf of Aden, as the 30,000-ton red-and-white-painted tanker carrying castor oil and a gasoline additive traversed “pirate alley” — an area of water between Somalia and Yemen known for its high number of hijackings — on its way from India to Rotterdam.
he ship slowed, and a sailor threw a ladder over its starboard side. The mariners watched as the six Somali pirates, armed with AK-47s, stepped onto the deck and headed straight for the bridge, where they ordered the captain to sail toward Somali waters. He refused. A pirate took off the captain’s glasses and slapped him hard across the face, making the demand plain: Comply, Makane testified, or be “physically abused.”",BASE_WAPO,177.93571496009827,15.048103094100952,162.5626881122589,367,900,177.61079120635986

Fishing boats are much less carefully regulated than other ships: Because fishing vessels are not required to have identification numbers, enormous ships are known to change names and flags of registration to stay a step ahead of authorities. Interpol issued two worldwide alerts last year for vessels that had done just that. Fishing vessels are not required to carry satellite transponders, which makes it easy for them to evade surveillance. Moreover, enforcement actions have traditionally been left to the states where the boats are registered, or “flagged,” rather than the “port” states where they bring their cargo to shore, where they would be more likely to be caught doing something illegal.

The combination of lax enforcement and the ability to escape detection has proved irresistible to criminals, who use IUU fishing as cover for other illicit activities. For instance, a State Department report noted that drug smuggling is often aided by fishing boats moving drugs through the Bahamas, Jamaica and Florida.

5642,415,0f6bfcefd3c4c02a0dc75ba2bd48303c,Somali pirates just hijacked an oil tanker. Here’s what pirates want — and where they strike., instances of piracy,3,1,1,5,"But violent pirate attacks increased in two places: the Celebes and Sulu Seas between the Philippines and East Malaysia, and the Gulf of Guinea off the Nigerian coast. In both places the number of pirate attacks more than doubled last year and were closely linked to rebel movement.

Some piracy hot spots — Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh and Vietnam — all experienced significantly less piracy in 2016 compared to 2015. Even more remarkable has been the virtual elimination of piracy around Somalia, where the Greater Gulf of Aden was for many years the most dangerous area for seafarers (see Figure 1).

These are the new piracy hot spots:

1. Southern Philippines — Abu Sayyaf, an Islamic militant group, regularly targets fishing trawlers and slow-moving tugboats. More recently, higher-profile merchant ships have been the focus of attacks, as kidnapping for ransom has proved lucrative and revenue from payments help fund Abu Sayyaf’s efforts directed against the Indonesian government. The militant group, while small, aims to establish an Islamic state in the southern Philippines.

In October, Abu Sayyaf militants hijacked the 400-foot Dongbang Giant 2 as it crossed the Celebes Sea, kidnapping three sailors. Less than a month later, the same group seized the Royal 16, a Vietnamese bulk carrier, and fled with six of the crew.

This group also kidnaps tourists from resorts on land. In August 2016, a ransom of $1 million was paid to the Abu Sayyaf for the release of Norwegian hostage Kjartan Sekkingstad, while $413,000 more won the release of Filipino Marites Flor.

Despite the Philippine government’s efforts to crush Abu Sayyaf, the Jakarta Post reported the group took in more than $7 million in ransom money to free 20 hostages seized during the first half of 2016.

The militant group used these funds to purchase weapons, ammunition and other supplies to counter a renewed Philippine military offensive — and implement an extensive series of bombings, including one detonated in the home town of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.

The Philippine and Indonesian governments announced plans in June to coordinate naval patrols in the Southern Sulu archipelago to curb the maritime threat and cut off Abu Sayyaf‘s coffers.

2. West Africa — Niger Delta militants, frustrated by inequitable resource distribution and environmental degradation from oil extraction, bomb oil pipelines in the Delta and target tankers and supply vessels servicing oil fields and platforms in the Gulf of Guinea. In February 2016, pirates hijacked the oil tanker Leon Dias, severely injuring one crew member.

Sri Lanka's foreign ministry confirmed that eight of its nationals were on board as crew. The E.U. naval force said pirates were asking for a ransom but the amount was not disclosed. The ship was on its way south to Mogadishu, Somalia's capital.

The attack originated in the Puntland region, which is semiautonomous. “The vessel’s captain reported to the company they were approached by two skiffs and that one of them could see armed personnel on board,” an unidentified Middle East-based official told the Associated Press. “The ship changed course quite soon after that report and is now anchored.”

5624,415,4aeac00ef53dcc15a91d217df7dfa01d,Falling oil prices spark a rise in kidnappings by West African pirates, pirates,2,1,0,5,"But on the other side of the African continent, a new hot spot is emerging. The Gulf of Guinea, a body of water tucked into the curve where West Africa meets Central Africa, is now the most dangerous region in the world for seafarers, according to a new report by the nonprofit organization Oceans Beyond Piracy (OBP).

The pirates in these waters are mostly from the Niger Delta, an oil-rich part of Nigeria that has seen two decades of violence as militias fight over control of land and resources. Before 2015, they mostly targeted oil tankers, siphoning the black gold by the metric ton and ferrying it back to the mainland, where they sold it on the black market. But the price of crude oil has fallen precipitously since mid-2014, which means that human hostages are now more valuable than their once-precious cargo.

The OBP report says that kidnapping for ransom became the region's ""most pervasive piracy model"" last year, and that trend has only escalated in the first quarter of 2016. ""In most kidnapping incidents the pirates board the vessel after firing at the bridge to suppress any opposition and intimidate the crew, and then proceed to isolate the ranking officers and engineers, who net the highest ransoms,"" the report said. ""The same pirate gangs responsible for these attacks are likely the same groups responsible for kidnapping and violence in the Niger Delta.""

In most cases, victims were brought to small islands in the delta where local militias have bases and held for two to three weeks.

Known ransoms have reached as high as $400,000 in the region, which is actually lower by orders of magnitude than the average ransom paid to pirates off the coast of Somalia, which the BBC reported at almost $5 million. Yet in a video made by OBP, the group claims that as many as 70 percent of kidnapping incidents in the Gulf of Guinea go unreported and that all but a few ransoms are paid through secret back channels. The gulf is a major transit point for cocoa and metal in addition to oil. Not one of the very few pirates who have actually been caught has been prosecuted, the report says, so crews don't report incidents out of fear that they will again come face-to-face with their captors on subsequent trips.",BASE_WAPO,39.505722999572754,34.41824197769165,4.416694164276123,367,890,38.83493614196777

The pirates in these waters are mostly from the Niger Delta, an oil-rich part of Nigeria that has seen two decades of violence as militias fight over control of land and resources. Before 2015, they mostly targeted oil tankers, siphoning the black gold by the metric ton and ferrying it back to the mainland, where they sold it on the black market. But the price of crude oil has fallen precipitously since mid-2014, which means that human hostages are now more valuable than their once-precious cargo.

This Thursday, it motored toward the Vietnamese coast under protection of a naval vessel. Pirates of unknown nationality had seized the ship Oct. 2 and kept its crew hostage while they siphoned a third of its cargo: some 2,000 metric tons of oil. ""They put knives on our throats and threatened to kill us if we resist,"" the ship's deputy captain told the Associated Press by cellphone. One crew member broke his leg after trying to flee the pirates, reported the AP.
Luckily, there were no fatalities. The pirates jumped ship with their stolen booty and the tanker had to enlist the help of a passing fishing vessel to figure out its location and call for help.

The incident marked the latest pirate attack near the Malacca Strait, a body of water that links the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, making it perhaps the world's most vital conduit for global shipping. It carries some 40 percent of world trade through its waters every year. The lands flanking these waters have been contested by local kingdoms and sultanates, Arabs, Chinese, and the forces of European colonial powers. Singapore, one of the world's most important ports, emerged in the 19th century as a pivotal entrepot straddling this passage. It was also, in its early days, a haven for pirates.
The attack was the 12th such pirate hijacking attempt in Southeast Asia since April, raising concerns about an escalation in piracy in this strategic waterway. The rise has been conspicuous enough that it initially dominated the fevered speculation surrounding Malaysian Airlines flight 370, when it tragically disappeared earlier this year.

From a dip in 71 attacks reported in the Malacca Strait and adjacent South China Sea in 2009, numbers surged back to 161 reported attacks in 2013. This graph from German news site Deutsche Welle lays out the trend over the past two decades.

But when he took the witness stand in a federal courtroom in Norfolk earlier this year, the ordeal he and his crew had endured was vivid in the captain’s mind: Makane described how his ship had been hijacked on a muggy May afternoon in 2010 and how the mariners suffered through 10 months of stifling confinement, death threats and torture.
His company had parachuted in a $5 million ransom, and the pirates had divvied up their loot. As the final two pirates stepped from the deck of the Marida Marguerite, one turned to address the crew. He was Mohammad Shibin, a smooth-talking, English-speaking Somali who had acted as the pirates’ negotiator with the German shipping company. He had also helped keep the crew in line, often brutally.
“You will definitely not like me to see you again,” the captain recalled Shibin saying as he left the tanker that December day. “If you see me, you will hate me.”

This year, Somali pirates have successfully hijacked 13 ships and continue to hold more than 180 hostages.

Shibin was arrested last year by the FBI shortly after he participated in the hijacking of the Quest, a U.S. sailboat on which four Americans were killed by Somali pirates. The 50-year-old former teacher — who learned English at school in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, is a father of five and once worked as an oil company dispatcher — was convicted of piracy and hostage-taking on the Marida Marguerite and the Quest. He was sentenced in August to life in prison.
The hijacking of the Marida Marguerite began May 8, 2010, in the Gulf of Aden, as the 30,000-ton red-and-white-painted tanker carrying castor oil and a gasoline additive traversed “pirate alley” — an area of water between Somalia and Yemen known for its high number of hijackings — on its way from India to Rotterdam.

An hour after the blip appeared, the ship’s 43-year-old chief engineer, Oleg Dereglazov, turned to the stern and spotted a small skiff loaded with six men, all carrying rifles. The skiff, pounding through the waves at 20 knots, was gaining on the lumbering tanker. The pirates fired a rocket-propelled grenade that arced over the Marida Marguerite, then another. If one of the rockets hit the vessel and its volatile cargo, Dereglazov later recalled, “there would be no ship nor pirates.”

The ship slowed, and a sailor threw a ladder over its starboard side. The mariners watched as the six Somali pirates, armed with AK-47s, stepped onto the deck and headed straight for the bridge, where they ordered the captain to sail toward Somali waters. He refused. A pirate took off the captain’s glasses and slapped him hard across the face, making the demand plain: Comply, Makane testified, or be “physically abused.”
Two days later, the ship was anchored off the Somali coast, where 60 armed pirates boarded. One was Shibin, who picked up a satellite phone and contacted a representative of the shipping company in Germany.

“Hello. I’m calling from the Marida Marguerite,” he said before putting the captain on the line. Makane told his bosses, “They are saying if their demands are not met, they will harass us and they will kill us.”

The nation’s largest airline, American, said last month that 70,000 of their passengers and 40,000 checked bags had missed their flights this year. United Airlines said it delayed 37 planes out of Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport one day in May so that passengers stuck in security lanes could make their flights.
A key reason that TSA found itself short-staffed this year was that under Neffenger’s predecessor, John S. Pistole, the agency had pivoted to an intelligence-based approach that suggested the need for fewer checkpoint screeners.

After Roth’s scathing report, Neffenger ended a practice that allowed randomly selected passengers to go through less stringent screening.

“While reliance on intelligence is necessary,” Roth said, “we believe that TSA in the past has overstated the effect of reliance on intelligence and a risk-based approach. There is no substitute for the checkpoint. Each and every passenger must be screened.”

In the other case, prosecutors convicted five Somali men who attacked the USS Nicholas. It was the first piracy conviction in a U.S. courtroom since 1819.
The Nicholas, which was part of the flotilla, was mistaken for a merchant ship because the Navy used a lighting array to disguise the 453-foot warship and attract pirates.

Two weeks ago, the count was 53 guns, and the week before that, it was 57. And if you’ve ever tried to slip through with a bottle of water, well, you probably got caught.
Without excusing the failures, Pistole said that members of the inspector general’s “Red Teams” sent out to do the testing have several advantages that would-be terrorists, in particular, and pistol-packing passengers do not. Because he didn’t have the specifics of the 70 tests, Pistole talked in general about Red Team tactics.

“They have the benefit of knowing what the [TSA] detection capabilities are — literally the specifications on each type of machine they’re trying to test,” he said. “They know what the [TSA’s standard operating procedures] are. They know what the training is for the [TSA officers], and they know what the response protocols are. So couple that with the fact that they can devise and construct and conceal these devices with the luxury of not having to worry about a [military] drone overhead or they’re not out in a hut in Yemen someplace.”
“Compared to a real-life terrorist situation, what’s missing from these covert tests is the ability to collect any intelligence,” Pistole said. “That is often the most important part of detecting and deterring a putative terrorist. When you take out the whole intelligence element of it, it really skews their ability to get through.”

Somali fishermen have said the attack on the Aris 13 was an attempt to end the scourge of illegal fishing, mostly by Asian ships, in their local waters.

We have a word for this, too, in the law, when government agents don’t allow us to leave freely: ”being in custody.” And the government cannot put me in custody when they have absolutely no reason to believe that I have broken the law – the 4th Amendment prohibits that. Nor can they say “you’ve consented to being in custody when you go to the airport,” any more than they can say “you’ve consented to being in custody whenever you leave your home, so we can grab you and hold you whenever we damn please.”
[A right to leave the screening area] greatly damages the prophylactic purpose of the search procedure. Such an option would constitute a one-way street for the benefit of a party planning airplane mischief, since there is no guarantee that if he were allowed to leave he might not return and be more successful. Of greater importance, the very fact that a safe exit is available if apprehension is threatened, would, by diminishing the risk, encourage attempts. Established search procedures are perhaps more valuable by what they discourage than by what they discover. I see no constitutional requirement, where a defendant knew by objective signs that he was incurring the possibility of a search, that he should thereafter be allowed to play heads-I-win, tails-you-lose.

On Jan. 12, 2015, police were alerted that Oddo had checked a bag with U.S. Airways with an undeclared firearm inside. The key word here is “undeclared,” because stowing a firearm in checked luggage is the only to lawful way to transport a firearm on a commercial flight. But you have to keep it unloaded and locked in a hard-sided container. You also have to declare each one with the airline.

But in this instance, the scanner found a Sig Sauer 9mm semiautomatic handgun in the bag. It was loose inside an inner pocket. It was unloaded, and there was no ammunition packed with it. And Oddo failed to declare it, authorities said.
Oddo was already at the gate waiting to board his flight for Palm Beach, Fla. when police had him paged. The officer asked Oddo if he had packed his own bags. He said he had, with help from his girlfriend. The officer asked if had anything that needed to be declared. “Not that I know of,” Oddo told the officer.

Tropical Cyclone Hudhud came ashore in India near the city of Visakhapatnam on Sunday with wind speeds over 100 mph and torrential rain, killing at least eight people in the states of Andhra Predesh and Orissa.

2. According to the Associated Press, at least 400,000 people were evacuated ahead of the storm, and damage in Visakhapatnam was significant: Visakhapatnam, one of the largest cities in southern India and a major naval base, bore the brunt of Hudhud’s fury. Television footage showed downed electrical poles, uprooted trees and debris strewn in the streets. Train and cellphone services were disrupted. Electricity was disconnected in parts of Andhra Pradesh to avoid electrocutions, said Arvind Kumar, a relief and rescue official.

3. “We had this cyclone hitting us at around 10:25 Indian Standard Time (04:55 GMT),” he said. “And at that point we had a wind speed of more than 205km/h,” which is around 127 mph. It is unclear if these wind speeds were sustained or gusts.

4. In any case, Hudhud was a powerful, deadly cyclone at landfall. Weather Underground’s director of meteorology Jeff Masters suggests the damage will probably end up looking similar to that of Tropical Cyclone Phailin in 2013:

5. One-minute resolution wind observations from Visakhapatnam showed a peak sustained wind of 73 mph at 9:44 am local time, with a peak gust of 119 mph at 10:30 am. The station stopped reporting data at that time. Communications are out to much of the most severely affected regions, and I expect Hudhud’s eventual toll will be similar to that of Category 4  Tropical Cyclone Phailin, which killed 45 people and did $700 million in damage in October 2013 to an area of India’s coast just north of where Hudhud hit.

The robotic lanes — set to be installed at Newark Liberty, Chicago O’Hare and Los Angeles international airports later this year — promise to reduce wait times up to 30 percent by improving the flow of luggage and reducing the impact of holdups.
Newark will receive the first of the new lanes this fall. When installation is finished, the airport’s C terminal will feature 17 automated lanes, according to United Airlines, who is partnering with TSA on the initiative. The security agency said the technology aims to improve safety.
But the lanes will likely be a welcome innovation for air travelers if they can expedite the screening process
The new lanes feature automated belts that feed bags into the X-ray machines, and send bins back into the queue after the screening concludes, the TSA said. Also, potentially threatening bags can be diverted so bins behind them can proceed along the conveyor without holding up lines.

As part of the enhancements, new, 25-percent-larger bins are equipped with radio tags so they can be tracked throughout the security lane. TSA says the bins will also be photographed.

United joins American and Delta as the only domestic carriers to host the modernized lanes, which allow up to five customers to fill their bins at the same time. United said lines will proceed faster even if TSA agents need to perform additional screening on customers further up the line.

Here are some tips to help you become more of an expert on security procedures:

Communicate. Tell TSA representatives if you have equipment or a condition that will affect what you or they need to do during screening. If you’d prefer to be more discreet, you can present them with a notification card (downloadable from the TSA Web site) to inform them of your needs. (The card won’t exempt you from screening, though.)

Know what’s in your bag. When you’re used to carrying something around, it’s easy to forget that you have it. Before you get in line, think like a stranger and go over everything that might be worth mentioning. Walton said that one of the biggest challenges for security staff arises when passengers neglect to tell TSA officers about medically necessary liquids or devices.

Understand the liquid rules. Medically necessary liquids are exempt from the 3.4-ounce container limit. Keep them separate from other items during screening, and inform the officers if liquids would be compromised by being opened for examination.

Don’t be a hero. If you have problems walking or standing, or if you use a mobility device such as a wheelchair or a scooter, there’s no need for you to struggle to do more than you feel physically capable of. If you have a choice, going through a metal detector requires less time on your feet than the imaging machines. If you can’t stand or walk through either of those, you’ll be screened during a pat-down.

Avoid the metal muddle. If you have a metal implant, you probably know whether it will set off the metal detector. If it will, choose the imaging machine or a pat-down instead.

Talk to your doctor before you leave. Travelers with certain internal medical devices or other items, such as radioactive implants, may need to avoid specific types of screening. People on oxygen should know whether they can disconnect from their equipment. It’s best to go over these types of concerns with your doctor well in advance.

Keep your cool. Items for keeping medically necessary liquids, gels or aerosols cold are allowed through security. They’ll be subject to the same screening as liquids or gels unless they’re frozen solid.

Stick together. If you’re traveling with someone who needs your help, whether it be a child or an adult with physical or intellectual disabilities, ask to be allowed to stay with the person. The special-needs traveler has to go through the metal detector or imaging technology on his or her own, but a travel companion may accompany the person during a pat-down.

Fido will need to be screened, too. Service dogs can be screened by metal detector or pat-down. The dogs can go ahead of, behind or with their owners, who won’t be separated from the animals.

Be aware of your options. If you have a cast or prosthesis, you may be able to be screened with a new imaging system that has been deployed at a number of airports, including Reagan National. The technology is slightly different from the standard imaging machines and, for example, allows officers to see through a cast.

Find the right line. Some airports have lines dedicated to travelers with disabilities and medical conditions. If one isn’t available, and you anticipate difficulties waiting in the queue, you can request to go to the front of the line, either through TSA Cares or by asking on-site staff.

One of them, Carol I. Glover, 61, of Alexandria, died of smoke inhalation, an autopsy found.

Amid the rescue effort, firefighters in the tunnel had trouble communicating by radio with commanders aboveground. Since then, Metro and the D.C. fire department have largely blamed each other for the problems, which they said have since been fixed.

Metro’s interim general manager, Jack Requa, told the transit agency’s board of directors that several days before the Jan. 12 incident, the D.C. fire department made technical changes to the way its radios work.

Because fire officials did not immediately alert Metro to the changes, Requa said, Metro did not make necessary changes to its underground signal-relaying equipment. As a result, firefighters’ radios did not work properly in the emergency.

In a published report on the incident, however, the District’s homeland security agency partly disputed Requa’s account, saying Metro equipment was at fault. Transit officials were “notified of the issue, but repairs were not made prior to the January 12 incident,” the report said.

In Montgomery, Piringer said, firefighters tested radio communication in Metro tunnels immediately after the Jan. 12 incident and found it working fine.

Hermine lacks the power to cause a worst-case scenario like hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, but even as a Category 1 storm, it will serve as a reminder of what could be. Mere nuisance flooding already causes drainage systems to bubble over in the Miami area, and strong winds can roil Tampa Bay until it’s level with sea walls that guard roads and homes.

In the most extreme hurricane, more than 2.5 million homes could be lost in Florida, according to CoreLogic, a global firm that assesses risks to property. Miami alone could see damage to 780,000 homes, nearly as many as the entire state of Louisiana, which ranked second among at-risk states in CoreLogic’s assessment. Tampa Bay would suffer damage to more than 450,000 homes, not too far below Texas, which ranked third among states. Fixing that much property in the state’s two most populous areas would cost more than $200 billion.

A report by a Boston firm a year earlier estimated that the damage would be far worse. The Tampa Bay area is the nation’s most vulnerable metropolitan area to a storm because the bay acts as a water funnel, Karen Clark & Co. said. Flooding in Tampa Bay alone could amount to $175 billion in damage, the company said. The area includes St. Petersburg, Clearwater, Tarpon Springs and about a dozen other coastal cities and towns.

“We’re basically on a peninsula out here hanging off the peninsula of Florida,” Sally Bishop, director of Pinellas County Emergency Management, said as Hermine approached Thursday. Pinellas County is the most densely populated in the state, filled with at-risk properties and people. “When you’re talking about 600,000 people, that’s pretty staggering to have that many having to get out of the way of storm surge.

2. And it appears everyone wants to be near the water. “Most of Florida’s 18 million residents live less than 60 miles from the Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico,” the council’s report said. “Three-fourths of Florida’s population resides in coastal counties that generate 79 percent of the state’s total annual economy.” The infrastructure that helps drive that economy is valued at about $2.5 trillion.",BASE_WAPO,86.15789699554443,24.466124057769772,61.459705114364624,408,897,85.9258291721344

Visakhapatnam, one of the largest cities in southern India and a major naval base, bore the brunt of Hudhud’s fury.

Twenty people died along the Gulf Coast as a direct result of Ike’s winds and flooding, and even more died across the central and eastern United States as the storm’s remnants moved through and produced flash flooding.
Thousands of families were left homeless after the storm damaged or destroyed their homes.

Portions of Galveston and Houston were not only left without power, but these power outages and damage to clean water infrastructure left some areas without running water for a period of time as well.

With 97 million more passengers expected to pass through TSA screening this year than did three years ago, adding several hundred new screeners, paying overtime and giving part-time TSA workers full-time jobs won’t be enough to make the long lines evaporate, Neffenger said.

“It was immediately apparent to me that one of the challenges we were going to have was to have enough screening staff to manage the checkpoints effectively,” Neffenger told the committee.

Congress acquiesced to his request to retain the 1,600 workers slated for layoffs. He said an additional 768 workers would be ready for service by June 15.

Neffenger said he also has other plans to reduce long lines. One is to introduce more airport dog teams trained to sniff out bombs. Another is to find funding to move the 20 percent of TSA’s trained screeners from part-time to full-time work.

The TSA also plans to actively promote enrollment in its Pre-Check program, the centerpiece in a trusted-traveler program that includes the Customs and Border Protection’s Global Entry program and other elements.

CLEAR, a membership-based screening program is now operating at both airports, offering fliers a chance to move to the front of TSA screening lines for fee.
David Cohen, chief administrative officer for the New York-based company said travelers should think of airport screening as a two-part process that consists of an ID and document check and then physical screening. CLEAR’s aim is to offer travelers a speedier path to physical screening, he said.

Instead of waiting in line to have your documents checked by a Transportation Security Administration officer, he said, travelers enrolled in CLEAR will move through special lines where their travel documents and identity will be checked using CLEAR’s biometric platform, a machine that scans their iris image or fingerprint. From there, they will be directed to physical screening. People enrolled in TSA’s Pre-Check program will be directed to that line; other travelers will move into the regular screening line.
Travelers must provide a government issued ID and take a brief quiz to verify their identity. In addition to being fingerprinted, travelers will have an iris scan and have their photo taken. Cohen said the process takes less than five minutes.  There is a $179 a year membership fee to enroll in CLEAR.
CLEAR also is offered at airports in San Francisco,  San Jose,  Denver, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston Bush, Houston Hobby, San Antonio, Austin, Orlando, Miami, Las Vegas and Westchester County in New York. Dulles and National are part of a major expansion the company has launched this year. The service begins this week in Seattle as well.

 a TSA inspector general sting found that undercover investigators were able to sneak weapons — both fake and real — past airport security nearly every time they tried. Enhanced security measures since then, combined with a rise in airline travel due to the improving economy and low oil prices, have resulted in long waits at major airports such as Chicago’s O’Hare International . It is not yet clear how much more effective airline security has become — but the lines are obvious.
the government did not anticipate the airline travel spike, so the TSA is now rushing to get new screeners on the line. Part of the issue is that airports have only so much room for screening lanes. Another factor may be that more people are trying to overpack their carry-on bags to avoid checked-baggage fees, though the airlines strongly dispute this

This allows the TSA to focus on travelers who are higher risk, saving time for everyone involved. TSA wants to enroll 25 million people in PreCheck
Passengers must pay $85 every five years to process their background checks. Since the beginning, this price tag has been PreCheck ’s fatal flaw.

Johnson said he had asked the TSA’s Aviation Security Advisory Committee to review the incidents and recommend remedies.

Anyone who boards an airplane other than on-duty pilots and crew will be screened, he said.

The New York Times on Friday asked, “Does More Security at Airports Make Us Safer or Just Move the Targets?” The article noted that Istanbul’s airport had more layers of protection than U.S. airports, including metal detectors for luggage and passengers as they enter the terminal.

The paper, citing Turkish officials, reported that the attackers tried to enter the building but were turned away at the security screening. They then retrieved firearms from their suitcases and returned; two of them then took advantage of the chaos to enter the terminal, the paper says.

In an interview on NPR’s “Here & Now,” former DHS security adviser Fran Townsend acknowledged that terrorists have demonstrated an ability to modify their tactics whenever new security measures are added. But she also suggested that identifying and engaging with attackers further from an enclosed space makes sense.

“So, in the example of Turkey, they do have a preliminary screening  right as you come in through the main door. And every time you harden, and push out your preliminary screening point, they find another vulnerability,” Townsend said. “The Turkish response, the law enforcement response there, was very quick. The numbers could have been much worse.”

Townsend also said the latest attack should prompt a reappraisal of security around “soft targets” such as shopping malls, perhaps by using metal detectors at the entrances, despite the potential risk of creating lines at those checkpoints that are vulnerable.",BASE,47.2730929851532,44.9931800365448,2.135615110397339,341,859,47.12879514694214

Travelers who use the TSA’s Pre-Check program can keep their shoes, belts and sweaters on and do not have to pull their laptops from cases or display their bags of liquids in special airport checkpoint lines.

In May, U.S. officials suggested the ban might be expanded to include direct flights to the United States from Europe. Later that month, in an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” Kelly suggested he might go even further and extend the ban to all international flights in and out of the United States.

European officials raised concerns about potential new restrictions and sought more information about the threats that prompted talk of an expansion.

It’s difficult to quantify, and security concerns prevent the agency from providing specifics. The number of air travelers who receive pat-downs is fairly low. Only those who have opted opt out of using full-body scanners or whose belongings have set off the X-ray machine are required to undergo the pat-downs. Travelers may also be frisked at random, as part of the agency’s “unpredictable” security measures.

TSA agents receive formal training for pat-downs. To conduct a search at an airport, agents must demonstrate proficiency in performing the procedure. Yet for all the talk of uniformity, the pat-downs can vary widely, according to people who have been subjected to them at security screening areas.

Melissa Hibbert-Brumfield, a makeup artist from Los Angeles, recently flew from Los Angeles International Airport to Atlanta. In the screening area, Hibbert-Brumfield says, the scanner detected an anomaly in her carry-on bag and asked her to step aside for a more thorough search.

• The wait to get to the metal detector itself can take anywhere from five minutes to an hour. You have basically no idea how long.

• If you're silly enough to have brought along more than 3 ounces of toothpaste, shampoo, liquor, water or some other liquid on your flight, you're going to have to either toss it or start the whole process over again. If, say, a friend or family member gives you a bottle of bourbon that consequently has sentimental value, you're going to have to pay $29 or whatever to check your bag or else watch a TSA inspector pour out the memories before your very eyes.

• At the end of the security line wait, you have to take off your shoes, jacket and belt, empty your pockets, pull your laptop and/or liquids (3 ounces or less!) out of your carry-on bag, and arrange all those into separate bins (one for the laptop alone, of course!). I usually expedite this process while waiting in line -- taking off my belt and emptying my pockets and putting the contents into my carry-on bag, taking out my laptop and holding it separately, and unlacing my shoes, though on at least one occasion this has ended with me tripping on my shoelaces, with hijinks ensuing.

• Once you've managed all that, you get to go through a metal detector or, better yet, a body scanner -- for looking under your clothes. While the infamously invasive Rapiscan scanner was phased out over inadequate privacy protections, body scanners generally aren't going anywhere.

In an occurrence called “electrical arcing,” power escaped from those cables, causing heat, melting and smoke, according to the NTSB, which on Friday issued a short, sparsely detailed preliminary report of its investigation.

“I think we got some answers, but I think a lot of questions remain,” Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) said after the briefing.

Among the unanswered questions is whether the arcing occurred because the cables had deteriorated as a result of not being properly maintained by Metro.",BASE,52.2789478302002,48.88752603530884,3.2470409870147705,363,859,52.13456702232361

Damiger said the stop seemed like a typical delay, and he was so unconcerned that he continued his conversation.

A disaster was already underway, but no one seemed to realize it.

A day after the tragedy on the Metro in which one person died and scores of others were hospitalized, more details of passenger ordeals emerged.

Damiger, for one, painted a terrifying picture of a slowly developing crisis that went from calm to panic. Others told of stricken fellow passengers coughing, vomiting, passing out and praying.

In Damiger’s case, it wasn’t long into his train’s stop before he realized something amiss.

“I said to my friend, ‘Look at that smoke,’ ” Damiger said. “I thought it was from the brakes.”

The smoke seemed to come in from “nowhere,” as Damiger put it. It was thick and smelled of burning brakes, plastic and oil and began to stream into the car. Damiger said some elderly riders immediately had trouble breathing, but most riders remained composed.

After two or three minutes, he said the train’s conductor began walking from car to car to reassure riders — the first of two or three passes the man would make through the train as the incident gradually unfolded.

The conductor told riders to remain calm. “There is no fire,” Damiger recalled the man saying. “Don’t try to open the door. I will call for help and they will get us back to L’Enfant Plaza.”

Damiger said smoke continued to billow into the car. After 15 or 20 minutes, riders became anxious. He said some wanted to smash the doors of the train to escape, but the conductor said to wait for help to arrive.

At the 30-minute mark, Damiger said anxiety turned to panic. Damiger said one man sputtered for breath on his knees. He had a cloth pressed to his mouth and a hand buttressed on the floor of the car for support. Other passengers appeared to have passed out. Many sunk to the floor of the train to gulp in whatever fresh air was still left.

Then, the screaming started.

“Open the door for us!”

“We need to get out!”

“We are dying!”

“Tell us something!”

“Make an announcement!”

“Stop telling us to calm down!”

At some point, Damiger said he happened upon a woman who started praying to calm a teenage girl in the seat next to her who had started crying.

“Lord, we are sure you don’t want us to die here,” Damiger recalled the woman saying. “Lord, please help us. Lord, we don’t want to die here.”

Damiger said the woman said, “amen,” and several others riders responded with their own “amens.”

Damiger said help finally arrived after the train was stranded for about 45 minutes.

He and other riders filed through the rail cars to reach the back of the train. He said he saw two or three people carrying a passenger, who appeared to be having seizures. He said emergency crews had opened a back and side door of the last car. Riders with disabilities were evacuated through the rear door, while other passengers hopped out the side door.

Damiger said the passengers inched along a narrow path between the wall of the tunnel and the Metro train, guided by firefighters with flashlights. He said he was shocked when it took just a couple of minutes to walk back to the L’Enfant Plaza station. He estimated it was roughly 200 feet away.

“When we went out to the platform and I realized we were so close. I didn’t know why the officer told us not to move from the train,” Damiger said. “It was a can of chaos. Nobody knew what to do.”

Passenger Jonathan Rogers recalled: “It started to get scary pretty quick.”

He said the train operator told them of a plan to get back to the platform of the L’Enfant Plaza station, but that effort apparently failed.

He said a man standing next to him started having breathing problems and sank to the floor. Other passengers who grew short of breath passed around inhalers. They also shared water bottles.

Rogers said that when a woman beside him passed out, he joined other riders in trying to revive her with CPR.

“We just kept doing it, maybe 25 minutes,” he said.

Looters have hauled away medical supplies, according to local media accounts. The half-dozen provinces hit most directly by Haiyan’s 150 mph winds still lack electricity or mobile connections. In some remote areas, relief can come only by boat or helicopter.

A clearer picture of the destruction came more fully into view early Tuesday as a wave of emergency workers reported conditions on the ground and the Philippine military provided aerial photos of towns ground into wood beams and rubble. Photos also showed survivors walking the streets, holding clothes against their noses to block the stench of bodies.

Southern Philippines — Abu Sayyaf, an Islamic militant group, regularly targets fishing trawlers and slow-moving tugboats. More recently, higher-profile merchant ships have been the focus of attacks, as kidnapping for ransom has proved lucrative and revenue from payments help fund Abu Sayyaf’s efforts directed against the Indonesian government. The militant group, while small, aims to establish an Islamic state in the southern Philippines.

In October, Abu Sayyaf militants hijacked the 400-foot Dongbang Giant 2 as it crossed the Celebes Sea, kidnapping three sailors. Less than a month later, the same group seized the Royal 16, a Vietnamese bulk carrier, and fled with six of the crew.

This group also kidnaps tourists from resorts on land. In August 2016, a ransom of $1 million was paid to the Abu Sayyaf for the release of Norwegian hostage Kjartan Sekkingstad, while $413,000 more won the release of Filipino Marites Flor.

Despite the Philippine government’s efforts to crush Abu Sayyaf, the Jakarta Post reported the group took in more than $7 million in ransom money to free 20 hostages seized during the first half of 2016.

The militant group used these funds to purchase weapons, ammunition and other supplies to counter a renewed Philippine military offensive — and implement an extensive series of bombings, including one detonated in the home town of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.

The Philippine and Indonesian governments announced plans in June to coordinate naval patrols in the Southern Sulu archipelago to curb the maritime threat and cut off Abu Sayyaf‘s coffers.

2. West Africa — Niger Delta militants, frustrated by inequitable resource distribution and environmental degradation from oil extraction, bomb oil pipelines in the Delta and target tankers and supply vessels servicing oil fields and platforms in the Gulf of Guinea. In February 2016, pirates hijacked the oil tanker Leon Dias, severely injuring one crew member. Nigerian pirates, many of whom are associated with the militant group MEND (Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta), boarded 17 other ships and fired upon nine more during 2016, a significant increase in maritime violence in the area.

Here’s how piracy pays off. These rebels appear to target oil tankers filled with refined petroleum, then siphon the fuel for resale on the black market. Since 2010, these attacks have netted the group an estimated $100 million, which helped procure materiel, pay fighters and support local communities.

Oil revenue accounts for as much as 75 percent of Nigeria’s revenue. Counter-piracy operations are also exceedingly costly and attacks against pipelines, production facilities and transports by similar militant groups in the past cut Nigerian oil production by two-thirds. Renewed violence targeting Nigeria’s energy infrastructure also threatens government revenue by reducing maritime traffic in the region.

Insurgencies last longer than they would without this source of funds

The link between pirates and rebels is reason for concern — our research shows how piracy and civil war occur in many of the same places. Although similar conditions drive both processes, our research suggests piracy can intensify land conflicts by providing rebels with valuable resources.

Social science research demonstrates that militant groups with a consistent revenue stream are better equipped to facilitate and sustain rebellions. Illicit trade in diamonds, narcotics and timber, for example, provides rebel leaders with funds to assemble fighting forces capable of confronting the government. Rebel movements located far from state power centers or concealed within impenetrable terrain are particularly difficult to suppress.

Our research, funded through the Minerva Initiative, suggests piracy similarly increases both conflict intensity and conflict length. Pirate attacks deliver significant revenue that encourages rebellion and motivates militant groups to continue fighting.

The elimination of resources to loot that are accessible to rebels, then, may help reduce violence and shorten conflicts. Without these resources, rebel leaders are more likely to return to the bargaining table to formulate a settlement that averts further large-scale hostilities.

In the Philippines, the Duterte regime appears to see counter-piracy operations as a tool for weakening the Abu Sayyaf. Cutting off this revenue source, together with renewed government offensives on land, may help produce a diplomatic opening to end the long-running civil war.",BASE_GOOGLE,9.115003824234009,7.343142986297607,1.6206660270690918,367,865,8.9638090133667

Shibin was arrested last year by the FBI shortly after he participated in the hijacking of the Quest, a U.S. sailboat on which four Americans were killed by Somali pirates. The 50-year-old former teacher — who learned English at school in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, is a father of five and once worked as an oil company dispatcher — was convicted of piracy and hostage-taking on the Marida Marguerite and the Quest. He was sentenced in August to life in prison. His court-appointed attorney, James O.

This Thursday, it motored toward the Vietnamese coast under protection of a naval vessel. Pirates of unknown nationality had seized the ship Oct. 2 and kept its crew hostage while they siphoned a third of its cargo: some 2,000 metric tons of oil. ""They put knives on our throats and threatened to kill us if we resist,"" the ship's deputy captain told the Associated Press by cellphone. One crew member broke his leg after trying to flee the pirates, reported the AP.

Luckily, there were no fatalities. The pirates jumped ship with their stolen booty and the tanker had to enlist the help of a passing fishing vessel to figure out its location and call for help.

The incident marked the latest pirate attack near the Malacca Strait, a body of water that links the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, making it perhaps the world's most vital conduit for global shipping. It carries some 40 percent of world trade through its waters every year. The lands flanking these waters have been contested by local kingdoms and sultanates, Arabs, Chinese, and the forces of European colonial powers. Singapore, one of the world's most important ports, emerged in the 19th century as a pivotal entrepot straddling this passage. It was also, in its early days, a haven for pirates.

The attack was the 12th such pirate hijacking attempt in Southeast Asia since April, raising concerns about an escalation in piracy in this strategic waterway. The rise has been conspicuous enough that it initially dominated the fevered speculation surrounding Malaysian Airlines flight 370, when it tragically disappeared earlier this year.

From a dip in 71 attacks reported in the Malacca Strait and adjacent South China Sea in 2009, numbers surged back to 161 reported attacks in 2013. This graph from German news site Deutsche Welle lays out the trend over the past two decades.

Half a decade ago, as the world fretted over the terrors of Somali piracy, strategists pointed to the relative success of counter-piracy measures in the Malacca Strait as a guide for how to deal with the threat of the Horn of Africa.

In an operation approved by President Obama, the SEALs commandeered the commercial tanker Morning Glory shortly after 10 p.m. Eastern time and were en route overnight to a Libyan port, Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement. No one was hurt during the operation, he said.

Libya’s fledgling government had strongly opposed the sale of oil by a militia in eastern Libya and at one point threatened to bomb the tanker, which it said at the time was a North Korean-flagged vessel. When it set sail last week, outraged lawmakers ousted Prime Minister Ali Zeidan through a no-confidence vote and installed the country’s defense minister as interim leader. Zeidan had become deeply unpopular for failing to rein in the militias that emerged during Libya’s 2011 civil war.

In a statement Monday, the Libyan government said its initial efforts to seize control of the ship had failed because of “bad weather and inadequate resources.”

The dispute over the ship underscored the weakness of the Libyan government and the extent to which the Obama administration is willing to use military force to support an oil-rich nation still reeling from the aftermath of its civil war.

Tell TSA representatives if you have equipment or a condition that will affect what you or they need to do during screening. If you’d prefer to be more discreet, you can present them with a notification card (downloadable from the TSA Web site) to inform them of your needs. (The card won’t exempt you from screening, though.)

Know what’s in your bag. When you’re used to carrying something around, it’s easy to forget that you have it. Before you get in line, think like a stranger and go over everything that might be worth mentioning. Walton said that one of the biggest challenges for security staff arises when passengers neglect to tell TSA officers about medically necessary liquids or devices.

Understand the liquid rules. Medically necessary liquids are exempt from the 3.4-ounce container limit. Keep them separate from other items during screening, and inform the officers if liquids would be compromised by being opened for examination.

Don’t be a hero. If you have problems walking or standing, or if you use a mobility device such as a wheelchair or a scooter, there’s no need for you to struggle to do more than you feel physically capable of. If you have a choice, going through a metal detector requires less time on your feet than the imaging machines. If you can’t stand or walk through either of those, you’ll be screened during a pat-down.

Avoid the metal muddle. If you have a metal implant, you probably know whether it will set off the metal detector. If it will, choose the imaging machine or a pat-down instead.

Talk to your doctor before you leave. Travelers with certain internal medical devices or other items, such as radioactive implants, may need to avoid specific types of screening. People on oxygen should know whether they can disconnect from their equipment. It’s best to go over these types of concerns with your doctor well in advance.

Keep your cool. Items for keeping medically necessary liquids, gels or aerosols cold are allowed through security. They’ll be subject to the same screening as liquids or gels unless they’re frozen solid.

Stick together. If you’re traveling with someone who needs your help, whether it be a child or an adult with physical or intellectual disabilities, ask to be allowed to stay with the person. The special-needs traveler has to go through the metal detector or imaging technology on his or her own, but a travel companion may accompany the person during a pat-down.

Fido will need to be screened, too. Service dogs can be screened by metal detector or pat-down. The dogs can go ahead of, behind or with their owners, who won’t be separated from the animals.

Be aware of your options. If you have a cast or prosthesis, you may be able to be screened with a new imaging system that has been deployed at a number of airports, including Reagan National. The technology is slightly different from the standard imaging machines and, for example, allows officers to see through a cast.

Find the right line. Some airports have lines dedicated to travelers with disabilities and medical conditions. If one isn’t available, and you anticipate difficulties waiting in the queue, you can request to go to the front of the line, either through TSA Cares or by asking on-site staff.",BASE_GOOGLE,21.17364907264709,19.0708909034729,1.9726500511169436,341,865,21.043540954589844

The fleet had been supporting the successful U.S. invasion of the Philippines.
During the next 24 hours Halsey ordered other course changes that sent “many of the ships into the core of the typhoon, with sixty-foot waves and sustained winds estimated at higher than 145 miles per hour.”

The resulting losses included three destroyers capsized and sunk, several other ships heavily damaged, and 146 planes on aircraft carriers destroyed when they broke loose and slid across decks, sometimes starting fires when their fuel tanks split. After the storm ended 790 officers and enlisted men were either dead or washed overboard and presumed killed.
Then, in May 1945, after a break to serve in Pearl Harbor and Washington, D.C., Halsey was again in command of the Third Fleet, which was operating near the Japanese island of Okinawa, where U.S. troops were fighting the fierce 82-day battle that ended on June 22.
On June 5, 1945, a typhoon, named Connie (some accounts call it “Typhoon Viper”), smashed into the Third Fleet on the open seas, with 50- to 60-foot seas, a central pressure of 28.30 inches, and sustained winds of about 115 miles per hour, with probable gusts to 150. Thirty-three ships were damaged, six lives lost, and, as in Cobra, airplanes destroyed when they broke loose; this time 76, half as many as in Cobra
On Oct. 24, 1945, after the war was over, Typhoon Louise hit the island of Okinawa, which the U.S. had turned into a major military base for the expected invasion of Japan in late 1945.

The typhoon seriously damaged U.S. ships and shore facilities on Okinawa, sinking 12 U.S. ships or boats, and washing 222 ships or small craft ashore as well as destroying most of the island’s military facilities.

At its peak intensity, Haiyan had a central pressure of 895 mb, the 12th lowest of any storm on record. Yet in terms of sustained wind speed, only three other cyclones on Earth were stronger – and none had ever hit land with such ferocity.

Typhoon Haiyan’s violent winds and torrential rainfall left behind a trail of destruction as it tracked through the central Philippines. The storm caused more than 6,000 deaths and up to $14 billion in economic damage.  

Hardest hit was Tacloban City, where a 20-ft storm surge inundated the area. Haiyan’s eye passed just south of Tacloban, placing the city’s 220,000 inhabitants at the mercy of the storm’s Category 5-equivalent winds.

After barreling through the Philippines, Haiyan entered the South China Sea and made landfall in Vietnam as a strong tropical storm. While the storm also caused flooding in Vietnam and southern China, the Philippines bore the brunt of Haiyan’s impact. Nearly two months after the storm, nearly 1,800 people are still missing and many more remain homeless.

Alongside Haiyan, all of the above events (plus several others not listed here) made 2013 another interesting year for record-setting weather around the globe.",BASE_TIS,65.8826220035553,46.9529869556427,18.56690502166748,408,837,65.51989197731018

Much more smoke was ahead, the result of an electrical malfunction on the tracks about 1,100 feet in front of the train’s lead car.

At 3:16 p.m., Hart said, Metro controllers in Landover reacted to the train operator’s report of smoke by turning on giant fans inside the L’Enfant Plaza station — behind the stationary train in the tunnel. The fans were activated in “exhaust mode,” Hart said, meaning they were sucking massive volumes of air in the direction of the station.

“This action pulled smoke” toward the station from the spot of the electrical meltdown deep in the tunnel, Hart said. As a result, the smoke was also moving in the direction of the stopped train, which was soon enveloped.

Then, at 3:24 p.m., according to Hart, the Landover controllers switched on another set of fans — inside a huge ventilation shaft about 1,100 feet in front of the train, near the source of the smoke. The shaft rises from the tunnel to the street.

But the fans in the shaft also were activated in exhaust mode, Hart said. This meant that the two sets of powerful fans, at both ends of the train, were sucking air in opposite directions, causing the smoke to linger in place, surrounding the train.

Making matters worse Jan. 12, Hart said, “the train ventilation system that draws air from the outside into the cars was not shut off by the train operator.” After the Yellow Line train stopped in the tunnel, the surrounding smoke permeated the six cars largely because it was pulled in by the train’s heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system.

It had formed in the eastern Pacific basin and was roughly 470 miles south-southeast of the state when it recurved toward the north to hit Kauai. It killed six people and destroyed more than 1400 houses and seriously damaged another 5,000. The damage was estimated at $2.3 billion in 1982 dollars.  Most of the damage was on Kauai, but Oahu also suffered serious damage.
Hawaii’s other damaging storms since 1950 are:

Hurricane Dot, which came from the east, hit Kauai on Aug. 6, 1959 with sustained winds as fast as 81 mph. At the time Kauai’s economy was based on farming, not today’s tourist resorts, homes, and condos. Dot did an estimated $6 million in damage to the sugar, macadamia nuts, and pineapple crops. Four days before Dot hit Hawaii an Air Force hurricane hunter airplane had reported its winds were 150 mph or faster. Hurricane hunters no longer routinely fly out of Hawaii.

Hurricane Nina, which didn’t directly hit Hawaii—its center passed 120 miles west of Kauai— produced 82 mph wind gusts in Honolulu on Dec. 1, 1957. Its heavy rain caused damage on Kauai and Oahu islands, but high surf on Kauai’s southern shore was blamed for most of the estimated $100,000 damage in 1957 dollars.

Hurricane Estelle formed in the eastern Pacific and on July 21, 1956. It was a Category 4 hurricane with 132 mph winds, when it was 900 miles southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. Fortunately, by the time its center passed 133 miles south of Hawaii’s southernmost point on July 23 its strongest winds had weakened 40 mph, barely a tropical storm. Nevertheless, by that time the 15- to 20-foot waves Estelle had generated were crashing into Hawaii’s southernmost “Big Island” and the island of Maui, destroying at least five houses and damaging others, causing $2 million in damage.

Hurricane Iwa, which hit Hawaii on November 23,1982 produced an estimated $234 million in damage, making it the state’s most expensive hurricane until Iniki hit 10 years later. Iwa heavily damaged the islands of Kauai, Oahu, and Niihau with wind gusts faster than 120 mph, 30-foot waves, and 8 feet of storm surge on the southern coast of Kauai even though its center passed 25 miles north of Kauai. While Iwa was blamed for only four deaths, it destroyed or seriously damaged 2,345 buildings, leaving 500 people homeless. Damages were estimated at $312 million in 1982 dollars.

Mayor Muriel E. Bowser’s office, says firefighters in the tunnel near the L’Enfant Plaza Metro station could not clearly communicate by radio with commanders outside because signal-boosting equipment wasn’t working properly.

Another issue involves the fans used to clear smoke from Metro’s tunnels. Transit experts said it was unclear whether the fans near L’Enfant Plaza worked properly Monday. And one Metro official said the agency’s maintenance records on tunnel fans are not current.

Choking passengers, one of whom died, were stuck for at least 35 minutes on a six-car Yellow Line train just south of the L’Enfant Plaza station.

One significant question involves the operation of fans in Metro’s tunnels, which are used to remove smoke during emergencies and to circulate air. The fans can pull or push air in different directions and can be operated remotely by Metro’s control center.

According to a preliminary NTSB report, the control center activated the tunnel fans near L’Enfant Plaza at 3:16 p.m. Monday, about a minute after the southbound train left the station and stopped in the tunnel, having encountered “an accumulation of heavy smoke.”

Video and witness accounts provided by passengers and first responders suggest that some of the fans weren’t working properly or were incorrectly activated, moving the smoke in the wrong direction, one transit expert said. He said the fans are powerful and, when used correctly, can remove smoke quickly.",RAND,68.18352007865906,14.121476888656616,53.87776398658752,363,823,67.99924087524414

 the National Transportation Safety Board said the tunnel calamity, near the L’Enfant Plaza station, was exacerbated by Metro’s inability to quickly identify the origin point of the smoke. Metro then activated two sets of tunnel ventilation fans at cross-purposes, pulling the smoke toward the train instead of pushing it away, the NTSB said.

In the Jan. 12 incident, scores of passengers were left gasping for air, with many sickened, after they were caught on a six-car Yellow Line train that stopped in a smoke-filled tunnel just south of the L’Enfant Plaza station. 

The origin of the crisis was a malfunction involving a bundle of power cables attached to the electrified third rail in the tunnel, the NTSB has said.

Although the malfunction apparently did not spark a major fire, it produced tremendous heat, causing melting and a large amount of smoke in a spot about 1,950 feet south of the L’Enfant Plaza station.

Landover control center switched on the fans under the L’Enfant platforms in exhaust mode, which meant that the fans were drawing the smoke toward the station — and toward the train — from deep in the tunnel.

at 3:24 p.m., the giant fans in the shaft roared to life. But those fans, like the two under the platform, were activated in exhaust mode. This meant that the two sets of fans, on opposite ends of the train, both were pulling the smoke. One set should have been pushing in fresh air while the other set expelled the smoke, Hart said.

Because the fans were not coordinated to create air circulation in the tunnel, the platform fans sucked the smoke toward the train while the shaft fans, pulling from the other direction, helped cause the smoke to settle over the train.The stranded passengers waited more than 30 minutes for rescuers to arrive and lead them back to the station on foot.",RAND,156.15132904052734,105.3441927433014,122.62799000740053,363,823,227.97218275070193

The two sets of fans, on opposite ends of the train, were both pulling the smoke instead of one set pushing while the other pulled, the NTSB said. As a result, the mass of fumes settled over the stationary train and stayed there.

In the letters, to Metro and other agencies, Hart also said that two of the six fans involved in the failed ventilation effort did not work.

Metro controllers in Landover reacted to the train operator’s report of smoke by turning on giant fans inside the L’Enfant Plaza station — behind the stationary train in the tunnel. The fans were activated in “exhaust mode,” Hart said, meaning they were sucking massive volumes of air in the direction of the station.

“This action pulled smoke” toward the station from the spot of the electrical meltdown deep in the tunnel, Hart said. As a result, the smoke was also moving in the direction of the stopped train, which was soon enveloped.

Landover controllers switched on another set of fans — inside a huge ventilation shaft about 1,100 feet in front of the train, near the source of the smoke. The shaft rises from the tunnel to the street.

The fire, which occurred near the Friendship Heights Metro station, prompted inspections of large portions of the Red Line and even some trains.

D.C. Council member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), the chairman of the Metro Board, said worn equipment probably was to blame.

The incident, first reported at 7:18 p.m. Saturday, appeared to involve an insulator, and Metro said it was “possibly the result of electrical arcing.”

“My overriding observation is this: Whatever it is, the system is old and these fires are caused, not always but in large part, by things that are wearing out,” Evans said.

Another passenger Saturday described a thin haze of smoke in her northbound train while it was on its way from Tenleytown to Friendship Heights. She said she could smell smoke in the fourth car of the train.

The smoke, according to the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department, was centered on an insulator on fire at the platform. Insulators prevent current from leaking from the third rail, which carries the electricity that powers the trains. Dirt, moisture or structural damage to the insulators can degrade their capacity to block the flow of current. As electricity begins to push through the insulator, it produces heat, smoke and sometimes fire in what is described as arcing.

Arcing insulators have been a persistent problem for the system. Earlier Saturday, an arcing insulator reported near the Bethesda Metro station led to single-tracking.",RAND,197.35335898399356,61.73350286483765,135.49993801116943,363,823,197.23344087600708

Hermine lacks the power to cause a worst-case scenario like hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, but even as a Category 1 storm, it will serve as a reminder of what could be. Mere nuisance flooding already causes drainage systems to bubble over in the Miami area, and strong winds can roil Tampa Bay until it’s level with sea walls that guard roads and homes.

In the most extreme hurricane, more than 2.5 million homes could be lost in Florida, according to CoreLogic, a global firm that assesses risks to property. Miami alone could see damage to 780,000 homes, nearly as many as the entire state of Louisiana, which ranked second among at-risk states in CoreLogic’s assessment. Tampa Bay would suffer damage to more than 450,000 homes, not too far below Texas, which ranked third among states. Fixing that much property in the state’s two most populous areas would cost more than $200 billion.",BASE_GOOGLE,19.89448094367981,16.89463496208191,2.8059091567993164,408,786,19.700544118881226

Late Wednesday, he asked President Obama to declare a federal emergency in Florida due to the storm’s “potential to bring devastating impacts to millions of Floridians.” In total, more than 2.5 million people were under evacuation orders from Florida to South Carolina.

Initial rain bands began to reach South Florida on Thursday morning, and Matthew is expected to begin strafing the state late Thursday and grind its way north on Friday, according to the National Hurricane Center. By early Saturday, hurricane conditions could extend into Georgia and South Carolina, the center forecast.

So far Shanghai has recorded a sustained wind of 20 mph and gusts up to 38 mph.

Conditions will continue to deteriorate in Shanghai as the center of Chan-hom moves closer over the next 12 hours. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center is forecasting Chan-hom to turn north as it comes ashore near the city of Ningbo on Saturday evening, local time. Around six hours later, the typhoon’s eye will be almost directly over Shanghai.

The China Meteorological Administration has issued the highest level warning and emergency response as Chan-hom approaches. Weather.com reports that nearly 60,000 people have been evacuated from coastal areas, and over 100 trains have been canceled in the region through Sunday.

Shanghai will likely go through a low tide and a high tide during the time that Chan-hom is over the city. Storm surge flooding is most likely to occur during high tide around 7:50 a.m. Saturday, local time. Fortunately it appears Chan-hom’s timing is on Shanghai’s side — Saturday’s high tide is nearly four feet lower than it will be late next week.

3238,254,56de2d6c6b1ec7832960752d879cd98c,"Remembering Hurricane Isabel, 10 years later (PHOTOS)", hurricane damage,6,1,1,6,"On September 18, 2003, Hurricane Isabel made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane between Cape Lookout and Ocracoke Island in North Carolina with winds of 105 mph.  The storm tracked northwest through North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and into Pennsylvania, causing over $5 billion in damage.  The storm became extratropical over Pennsylvania and tracked into Canada.

Isabel was one of the most damaging storms to impact the Middle Atlantic States since Agnes in 1972 and Hazel in 1954.  Isabel was comparable to the great Potomac-Chesapeake Hurricane of 1933 in Virginia and Maryland regarding storm surge and damage to the coastline.

In the Washington area, Isabel caused severe tidal flooding and widespread tree damage.  Hundreds of thousands of people lost power and some areas were without power for over a week.  The tidal flooding in Washington, D.C. exceeded the record set by the Potomac-Chesapeake Hurricane of 1933.

Hurricane Isabel started as a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on September 1, 2003.  It struggled to develop for several days until it achieved tropical storm status on September 6.

The storm strengthened into a hurricane on September 7 and then it reached a rare Category 5 status with peak winds of 165 mph on September 11.  Hurricane Isabel’s strength fluctuated as it tracked east-northeast across the ocean and it achieved Category 5 status on three different occasions.

Hurricane Isabel slammed into the Outer Banks of North Carolina as a Category 2 hurricane.  Isabel produced extensive damage across eastern North Carolina.  The loss was in excess of $450 million.

The damage was heaviest along the coastline where the storm surge and strong winds damaged thousands of houses. During the storm, Hatteras Island in North Carolina was breached, creating an inlet that was later named, Isabel Inlet.  During the storm, over 700,000 residents lost power in North Carolina.

The damage at Colonial Beach was extremely bad and it rivaled the damage produced by Hurricane Hazel.  In Old Town Alexandria, the storm surge on the Potomac River topped the record set back in 1933 by the Potomac-Chesapeake Hurricane.  The flooding swamped the historic Torpedo Factory and many areas around King Street.  Along Alexandria’s waterfront, streets were navigated by canoe and kayak.

In Washington, the peak wind gust was recorded at 71 mph by the National Academy of Science. At Reagan National Airport, the peak wind gust reached 58 mph.

Within the city, over 1,500 trees fell, many landing on homes and cars.  At the White House, a tree fell in the front garden.

Tides ran five to eight feet above normal along the Chesapeake Bay which swamped Baltimore and Annapolis with record tides.  In Annapolis, the tide reached 7.58 feet above normal which broke the record set by the Hurricane of 1933.  At the United States Naval Acedemy, water filled hallways and classrooms.

Record tides flooded Baltimore’s Inner Harbor and historic Fells Point.  Clusters of condominiums and stores appeared to be islands surrounded by the water of the Chesapeake Bay.",BASE_GOOGLE,53.74638295173645,3.57395601272583,49.92647504806519,408,809,53.50043106079102

August 29th is a date remembered on the northern Gulf Coast as the day Hurricane Katrina changed not only the lives of its inhabitants, but served as a pivotal moment in the history of the country.

The strong Category 2 storm made a direct landfall in Galveston, Texas, at 2:10 a.m. CDT on September 13, 2008, bringing with it 110 mph sustained winds, over 18 inches of rain in some spots, and a storm surge that reached 20 feet deep along portions of the Texas coast.

Spatially, Ike was a massive storm. As the system neared landfall, Ike’s tropical storm force winds extended an incredible 275 miles away from its eye, and hurricane force winds extended upward of 120 miles from the eye. The immensity of the hurricane was also the main reason it was so damaging. Sustained winds between 80 and 90 mph impacted the densely-populated Galveston and Houston metropolitan areas for a longer period of time than one would normally find in a hurricane, causing additional stress to buildings and vegetation, and ultimately leading to more damage.

According to the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Ike was the third costliest hurricane in American history, behind Hurricanes Katrina (2005) and Sandy (2012), respectively, causing over $30 billion in damages in the United States alone. The economic damages only tell part of the story – the old adage that “material things can be replaced, but lives cannot” is why Ike is remembered so vividly by those who lived in its path.

Twenty people died along the Gulf Coast as a direct result of Ike’s winds and flooding, and even more died across the central and eastern United States as the storm’s remnants moved through and produced flash flooding. As a result of the Houston-Galveston area’s dense population (it was home to roughly six million people in 2012), human suffering was particularly amplified in areas that were hardest hit by the storm.

Thousands of families were left homeless after the storm damaged or destroyed their homes. Power outages affected nearly three million people at one point – some living without power for weeks on end. Portions of Galveston and Houston were not only left without power, but these power outages and damage to clean water infrastructure left some areas without running water for a period of time as well. Grocery stores experienced food shortages and gas stations experienced gas shortages. ",BASE_GOOGLE,55.03381514549256,10.62182116508484,44.06223821640015,408,809,54.684059381484985

3184,254,b146bffb9af62003fd3d75726b37311c,Florida’s losses from a big hurricane could reach a mind-blowing $200 billion, hurricane damage,6,1,0,6,"Since Hurricane Wilma made landfall at Cape Romano near the pointy end of the state in 2005, about 20 hurricanes have formed in the Atlantic Ocean and hit other states, and more than 60 wobbled off to deep waters without harming the U.S. coast. But Florida’s string of good fortune might be at an end.

A storm is on the horizon, projected to hit the Florida Panhandle late Thursday or early Friday. Forecasters predicted that Tropical Storm Hermine would only gush rain, but they recently elevated it to hurricane status. Floridians have many reasons to worry. The sea level is rising faster than first predicted, and analysts who assess potential property damage say that contributes to Florida being more vulnerable to massive losses than any other state.

In the most extreme hurricane, more than 2.5 million homes could be lost in Florida, according to CoreLogic, a global firm that assesses risks to property. Miami alone could see damage to 780,000 homes, nearly as many as the entire state of Louisiana, which ranked second among at-risk states in CoreLogic’s assessment. Tampa Bay would suffer damage to more than 450,000 homes, not too far below Texas, which ranked third among states. Fixing that much property in the state’s two most populous areas would cost more than $200 billion.

Hermine lacks the power to cause a worst-case scenario like hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, but even as a Category 1 storm, it will serve as a reminder of what could be. Mere nuisance flooding already causes drainage systems to bubble over in the Miami area, and strong winds can roil Tampa Bay until it’s level with sea walls that guard roads and homes.

It would take a mighty wind to create its worst-case scenario, a Category 4 with gusts of up to 150 mph — larger than Katrina in New Orleans, to bring about the worst case scenario in the KCC report. Tampa and its surrounding area has been more fortunate than most Florida cities; a major storm hasn’t scored a direct hit since 1921. Hurricane Charley was headed there in 2004, Karen Clark & Co. noted, “but just before landfall made an unexpected turn to the south.”

A Category 3 or greater hurricane would wreak havoc similar to Hurricane Sandy in New York and New Jersey. “You could very well see 25 feet of water where we are right now in downtown Tampa,” Brian LaMarre, a meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service’s local station, told the Tampa Bay Times.

Nothing, it seems, can protect the Florida coast from rising ocean waters driven by hurricane-force winds. The reason was spelled out in a 2010 report by the Florida Oceans and Coastal Council in Tallahassee. There are 1,200 miles of coastline and 11,000 square miles of bays, estuaries and coastal waters in a state where the highest point is about 400 feet above sea level.

And it appears everyone wants to be near the water. “Most of Florida’s 18 million residents live less than 60 miles from the Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico,” the council’s report said. “Three-fourths of Florida’s population resides in coastal counties that generate 79 percent of the state’s total annual economy.” The infrastructure that helps drive that economy is valued at about $2.5 trillion.

The timeline, obtained by The Washington Post from three District officials with access to dispatch records, shows that after firefighters arrived on the L’Enfant Plaza underground platform shortly after 3:30 p.m., they had to wait 13 minutes before moving into the tunnel and toward the train because they needed assurance from Metro that power to the electrified third rail had been cut.
According to the timeline, the first rescues started soon after firefighters received permission to move into the tunnel, at 3:44 p.m., and after they walked single-file down 800 feet of track, in the dark and smoke, to reach the first of six cars on the train. By then it was nearly 4 p.m.

The sequence helps clarify how the District reacted to the emergency amid complaints from passengers that they were trapped for what seemed an interminable amount of time.

At 3:28 p.m., the fire department declared a “Metro tunnel box alarm,” which means a possible fire in a tunnel and triggers the response of five engines, two trucks, a medic and an ambulance. The first firefighters arrived at L’Enfant Plaza station near Seventh and D streets SW at 3:31 p.m. By then, 911 operators had been flooded with calls, and firefighters rushing toward the station were met with hundreds of fleeing passengers, many coughing and needing help. The first call from a passenger on the train to 911 came at 3:33 p.m., saying it was filling with smoke.

At 3:44 p.m., Metro alerted firefighters that electricity to the third rail had been shut off and it was safe to enter the tunnel. Two more passengers called 911 asking whether help was on the way and the fire department struck a second alarm, drawing more personnel.

In a tunnel, there are gaps in the third rail where ventilation shafts are located so that during an evacuation, people can get out through a shaft without the danger of stepping on the third rail. The gaps, commonly about six feet wide, are bridged by jumper cables, which are insulated power lines the keep electrical current flowing along the third rail.

The agency also suspended bus service for the weekend, as well as MetroAccess, the door-to-door van service for disabled riders.

In announcing the shutdown, Wiedefeld said that the snowfall, which could exceed two feet in parts of the region, would make above-ground train service virtually impossible during the storm. And he said high winds and resulting electrical outages might have stranded riders in tunnels if Metro had tried to operate trains only in underground parts of the system.

By sheltering about 900 rail cars in tunnels and allowing workers unfettered access to the idle tracks, he said, crews can continue plowing throughout the weekend, keeping up with the snowfall, and will not have to shovel out hundreds of snowbound rail cars after the storm, which might not end until Sunday.

But the planned upgrades, meant to help Metro pinpoint the location of smoke and coordinate the work of ventilation fans, have not advanced beyond the paperwork stage.

The documents — prepared for a possible contract for new computer software for Metro’s train-control center in Landover, Md. — indicate that the agency knew its system for dealing with smoke in tunnels needed to be modernized. For a year, however, Metro moved at a less-than-urgent pace in trying to complete the improvements.

Then disaster struck.

Last week, in its first substantial disclosures about the Jan. 12 incident, the National Transportation Safety Board said the tunnel calamity, near the L’Enfant Plaza station, was exacerbated by Metro’s inability to quickly identify the origin point of the smoke. Metro then activated two sets of tunnel ventilation fans at cross-purposes, pulling the smoke toward the train instead of pushing it away, the NTSB said.

Although the malfunction apparently did not spark a major fire, it produced tremendous heat, causing melting and a large amount of smoke in a spot about 1,950 feet south of the L’Enfant Plaza station.

At the top of the shaft are four ventilation fans, each five feet wide. In “exhaust mode,” with the blades spinning counterclockwise, the fans can pull a total of 200,000 cubic feet of foul air out of the tunnel every minute. In “supply mode,” with the blades turning clockwise, they can push in fresh air at a rate of 140,000 cubic feet per minute.

Train No. 302 headed south with more than 200 passengers, departing L’Enfant Plaza at 3:14 p.m. A minute later, the train encountered smoke and stopped, with its front car 836 feet beyond the station.

Two other workers were critically injured in the explosion and fire that broke out in a Red Line tunnel where track work was underway as part of Metro’s major system rebuilding project.

A Metro spokesman said leaking hydraulic fluid on an underground vehicle apparently was ignited by welding equipment, causing an explosion and fire.

Until the incident, which occurred near Union Station shortly after midnight, it appeared that reconstruction had gone relatively smoothly, despite some riders’ surprise at the closure of five key stations, from Farragut North to Union Station.

Five key stations — Farragut North, Metro Center, Gallery Place, Judiciary Square and Union Station — were all closed as of 10 p.m. Friday for major rebuilding as part of a $5 billion capital campaign. Riders were able to use the Blue and Orange lines at Metro Center and the Yellow and Green lines at Gallery Place. Plans had called for the five stations to remain closed until the start of service Monday morning.

The defendants were prosecuted in Norfolk, the first in a series of government prosecutions aimed at slowing the spread of piracy off Africa.

The court’s ruling gives prosecutors wider latitude to go after people who attack U.S. vessels, U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride said.

“For decades, the international community has considered violent attacks on the high seas as an act of piracy, and today’s ruling will strengthen our ability to hold those who attack U.S. vessels by force accountable, regardless of whether they are successful or not,” said MacBride, whose office handled both cases.

In one case, a lower court judge dismissed charges against five Somalis in an attack on the USS Ashland, ruling that because the men had not taken control or robbed the ship, their actions did not rise to the definition of piracy. The ruling sends that case back to U.S. District Court for trial, the government said.

U.S. officials announced Friday that the fishermen had been rescued by a Navy destroyer the day before, more than 40 days after their boat was commandeered by suspected Somali pirates in the northern Arabian Sea.

On Tuesday, Tehran told the United States to keep the carrier strike group to which the destroyer belonged out of the Persian Gulf. Iran is preparing to send naval vessels to the Gulf of Mexico in a few months, officials have said.

But the Foreign Ministry, which is headed by an ally of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, broke an initial silence Saturday, welcoming the rescue and saying it set an example for other countries.

“The rescue of Iranian sailors by American forces is considered a humanitarian gesture, and we welcome this behavior,” ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast was quoted as saying by state TV’s al-Alam Arabic-language channel.

“We think all nations should display such behavior,” he said.

The response marked a letup after weeks of rising tensions between Iran and the United States, which is leading efforts to implement a boycott of Iranian oil. In response, Iran’s navy started war games last month during which it threatened to close the strategic Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf gateway for about 30 percent of the world’s oil and gas.

Metro then activated two sets of tunnel ventilation fans at cross-purposes, pulling the smoke toward the train instead of pushing it away, the NTSB said.

In the Jan. 12 incident, scores of passengers were left gasping for air, with many sickened, after they were caught on a six-car Yellow Line train that stopped in a smoke-filled tunnel just south of the L’Enfant Plaza station. One woman died, and an autopsy found smoke inhalation to be the cause. Because of the ongoing NTSB investigation, Metro has said it is barred by federal regulations from commenting in detail on the incident.

In what apparently was the first indication of trouble Jan. 12, a tunnel smoke detector near the L’Enfant Plaza station activated at 3:04 p.m., Hart said. Yet Metro train controllers, evidently unable to pinpoint the origin of the smoke, did not halt train traffic.

The incident Monday afternoon near L’Enfant Plaza Metro station ended with the hospitalization of 84 passengers and the death of Carol Glover, 61, a federal contractor and grandmother from Alexandria, Va.


D.C. firefighters had to resort to cellphones after their radios stopped working during the rescue of passengers aboard a stranded train in a smoke-filled tunnel in downtown Washington on Monday, and Metro officials had known for at least four days prior that emergency radios were not working properly in the tunnels.

As D.C. firefighters dispatched trucks and ambulances — and later, as they descended into L’Enfant Plaza station — first responders were not told by Metro for 20 minutes that a train filled with passengers was stranded in a tunnel, the city’s report said.

Firefighters were dispatched to the station at L’Enfant Plaza on Jan. 7, and a supervisor wrote in an e-mail to Metro the next morning that firefighters were unable to get 800-megahertz radio coverage “anywhere in the station.”

Their friends Riggle, 67, and Macay, 59, joined them as crew members for the trip across the Indian Ocean.

The four traveled in a group of boats for some of the journey but cut away when they neared Oman.

About 200 miles southeast of the Arabian Peninsula, 19 pirates who had been cruising the Indian Ocean for more than a week spotted the Quest. They were trolling the seas in a commandeered Yemeni boat to which they had roped their fast-moving skiff. They were armed with 12 assault rifles and one bazooka with four rockets, according to court papers.

The Quest was easily captured, and the Yemenis and their boat were cut loose after the pirates clambered aboard the American boat. They then turned back toward Somalia.

Two days later, American warships appeared on the horizon. Navy and FBI agents had flown out to the ships after the U.S. government learned about the hijacking, and they established radio communication with the pirates.

Defense lawyers say in court papers that Scott Adam repeatedly told the Navy by radio to keep its distance so as not to trigger a violent response from the pirates.

The U.S. negotiators eventually persuaded two of the Somalis to ferry over to one of the American destroyers, the USS Sterett, for face-to-face negotiations. The leader of the pirate group rejected a deal under which the Somalis would be allowed to keep the Quest but would have to surrender the Americans. “That prompted the Navy to hold the pair,” according to defense papers.

The standoff became tense as Navy vessels closed in on the Quest. One of the pirates fired a rocket at the Sterett, and small-arms fire erupted on the yacht. Navy SEALs then stormed the boat.

Those cooperative efforts largely succeeded, as have recent patrols in and around the similarly bustling Strait of Malacca, in Southeast Asia, where pirate attacks have fallen steeply in the past six months. In 2015, there were 17 pirate attacks near Somalia, down from 151 in 2011.

The Gulf of Guinea, a body of water tucked into the curve where West Africa meets Central Africa, is now the most dangerous region in the world for seafarers, according to a new report by the nonprofit organization Oceans Beyond Piracy (OBP).

The pirates in these waters are mostly from the Niger Delta, an oil-rich part of Nigeria that has seen two decades of violence as militias fight over control of land and resources.

The skiff, pounding through the waves at 20 knots, was gaining on the lumbering tanker. The pirates fired a rocket-propelled grenade that arced over the Marida Marguerite, then another. If one of the rockets hit the vessel and its volatile cargo, Dereglazov later recalled, “there would be no ship nor pirates.”

The ship slowed, and a sailor threw a ladder over its starboard side. The mariners watched as the six Somali pirates, armed with AK-47s, stepped onto the deck and headed straight for the bridge, where they ordered the captain to sail toward Somali waters. He refused.

In October, Abu Sayyaf militants hijacked the 400-foot Dongbang Giant 2 as it crossed the Celebes Sea, kidnapping three sailors. Less than a month later, the same group seized the Royal 16, a Vietnamese bulk carrier, and fled with six of the crew.

This group also kidnaps tourists from resorts on land. In August 2016, a ransom of $1 million was paid to the Abu Sayyaf for the release of Norwegian hostage Kjartan Sekkingstad, while $413,000 more won the release of Filipino Marites Flor.

The nightmare finally ended, the captain said, three days after Christmas. His company had parachuted in a $5 million ransom, and the pirates had divvied up their loot. As the final two pirates stepped from the deck of the Marida Marguerite, one turned to address the crew. He was Mohammad Shibin, a smooth-talking, English-speaking Somali who had acted as the pirates’ negotiator with the German shipping company. He had also helped keep the crew in line, often brutally.

The hijacking of the Marida Marguerite began May 8, 2010, in the Gulf of Aden, as the 30,000-ton red-and-white-painted tanker carrying castor oil and a gasoline additive traversed “pirate alley” — an area of water between Somalia and Yemen known for its high number of hijackings — on its way from India to Rotterdam.

In a carefully orchestrated shutdown that started at 10 p.m. Friday, Metro had turned off the power on the tracks, closed a busy Red Line stretch from Farragut North to Union Station and brought in about 100 Metro workers and contractors to do maintenance with a dozen different pieces of equipment on the tracks.

But early Sunday morning, things went drastically wrong.

About 400 feet from the Union Station platform, in the direction of Glenmont, flames erupted and a “loud noise” boomed in the underground tunnel near a piece of equipment on the tracks, according to Metro. It was reported as an explosion by some people on the tracks.

Initially, Metro officials said they thought that leaking hydraulic fluid from an underground vehicle apparently was ignited by welding equipment, causing the explosion and fire. That somehow caused a long and heavy piece of iron rail to move and strike the three workers, who were about 80 feet away. They were part of a crew that was ripping out old sections of rail along the closed section of track and putting in new ones.

Damiger, for one, painted a terrifying picture of a slowly developing crisis that went from calm to panic. Others told of stricken fellow passengers coughing, vomiting, passing out and praying.

In Damiger’s case, it wasn’t long into his train’s stop before he realized something amiss.

“I said to my friend, ‘Look at that smoke,’ ” Damiger said. “I thought it was from the brakes.”

This post from January 2017 explains the trends in maritime piracy, which declined sharply from 2010 levels.
There were fewer than 200 maritime pirate attacks in 2016, the lowest level in more than 20 years. Total global incidents declined nearly 22 percent from 2015 — and nearly 60 percent from 2010, when Somali piracy captured the world’s attention. Some piracy hot spots — Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh and Vietnam — all experienced significantly less piracy in 2016 compared to 2015. Even more remarkable has been the virtual elimination of piracy around Somalia, where the Greater Gulf of Aden was for many years the most dangerous area for seafarers . In October, Abu Sayyaf militants hijacked the 400-foot Dongbang Giant 2 as it crossed the Celebes Sea, kidnapping three sailors. Less than a month later, the same group seized the Royal 16, a Vietnamese bulk carrier, and fled with six of the crew.

This group also kidnaps tourists from resorts on land. In August 2016, a ransom of $1 million was paid to the Abu Sayyaf for the release of Norwegian hostage Kjartan Sekkingstad, while $413,000 more won the release of Filipino Marites Flor.",BASE,134.83487510681152,18.064402103424072,116.5973551273346,367,771,134.66175723075867

By early Monday afternoon, CSX Transportation was in the process of removing the damaged cars from the site, and all the tank cars had been offloaded, D.C. fire emergency officials said. Officials said all of the leaks had been contained but provided no clues into the cause of the wreck.

The Federal Railroad Administration is investigating the early-Sunday derailment of the 175-car train, which kept some residents away from their homes for hours, forced the closure of a Metro station and snarled traffic for much of the day. The wreck also disrupted MARC and Amtrak service, which use the tracks.

Officials had said Sunday that 14 cars derailed but upped the number to 16 Monday. Three of the tank cars were found to be leaking, including 750 gallons of the liquid content of a tanker containing sodium hydroxide. CSX described sodium hydroxide — also known as lye — as a chemical “used to produce various household products, including paper, soap and detergents.”

Officials said there was no threat to the air or water supply.

One scrap-metal hopper car is too damaged and will be cut up on site and removed using industrial equipment, officials said. After the train cars are removed from the site, CSX will begin soil remediation in the area affected by the sodium hydroxide spill, the company said.

The hijacking of the Marida Marguerite began May 8, 2010, in the Gulf of Aden, as the 30,000-ton red-and-white-painted tanker carrying castor oil and a gasoline additive traversed “pirate alley” — an area of water between Somalia and Yemen known for its high number of hijackings — on its way from India to Rotterdam.

That’s when the crew noticed a blip on the ship’s radar. It was approaching. Fast. It could be only one thing: pirates.

Crew mates assembled on the bridge and hoped that their precautions would be enough. The ship was wrapped in razor wire, and sailors were ready to grab fire hoses to jettison any pirates who managed to board.

An hour after the blip appeared, the ship’s 43-year-old chief engineer, Oleg Dereglazov, turned to the stern and spotted a small skiff loaded with six men, all carrying rifles. The skiff, pounding through the waves at 20 knots, was gaining on the lumbering tanker. The pirates fired a rocket-propelled grenade that arced over the Marida Marguerite, then another. If one of the rockets hit the vessel and its volatile cargo, Dereglazov later recalled, “there would be no ship nor pirates.”

The ship slowed, and a sailor threw a ladder over its starboard side. The mariners watched as the six Somali pirates, armed with AK-47s, stepped onto the deck and headed straight for the bridge, where they ordered the captain to sail toward Somali waters. He refused. A pirate took off the captain’s glasses and slapped him hard across the face, making the demand plain: Comply, Makane testified, or be “physically abused.”

‘I myself am not a pirate’

Two days later, the ship was anchored off the Somali coast, where 60 armed pirates boarded. One was Shibin, who picked up a satellite phone and contacted a representative of the shipping company in Germany.

“Hello. I’m calling from the Marida Marguerite,” he said before putting the captain on the line. Makane told his bosses, “They are saying if their demands are not met, they will harass us and they will kill us.”

Taking back the phone, Shibin added: “I myself am not a pirate. I work for a local NGO, a human rights NGO in this area. And I volunteered to do this job because I want to save their lives, and I don’t want these animals to get rid of your crew, okay?”

But to the ship’s crew, it appeared that Shibin was taking orders from the pirates’ commanders.

Over the next few days, Shibin pressed Makane and other crew members about the value of the tanker, its cargo, its food and fuel supplies, and its ability to produce fresh water. He befriended the second officer, who provided valuable information in exchange for privileges. Only then did Shibin make the pirates’ initial demand.

“They are asking for $15 million,” he told the company representative, subtly distancing himself from the pirates.

“Did you say $15 million?” asked an incredulous shipping company official.

Torture on the ship

As days turned to weeks, Shibin continued to speak periodically with the shipping company; the crew lived on the bridge. The pirates roamed the ship, sipped tea and looted whatever valuables they could find. They also chewed copious amounts of the stimulative plant khat. Shibin ate so much that his belly became as round as an ocean buoy, and he soon earned the nickname “Dracula” because he seemed to appear only at night, when he was enjoying khat with the pirates.

Makane described how his ship had been hijacked on a muggy May afternoon in 2010 and how the mariners suffered through 10 months of stifling confinement, death threats and torture.

The nightmare finally ended, the captain said, three days after Christmas. His company had parachuted in a $5 million ransom, and the pirates had divvied up their loot. As the final two pirates stepped from the deck of the Marida Marguerite, one turned to address the crew. He was Mohammad Shibin, a smooth-talking, English-speaking Somali who had acted as the pirates’ negotiator with the German shipping company. He had also helped keep the crew in line, often brutally.",BASE_TIS,138.57517790794373,12.07413101196289,126.31079292297365,367,764,138.38492393493652

The ship slowed, and a sailor threw a ladder over its starboard side. The mariners watched as the six Somali pirates, armed with AK-47s, stepped onto the deck and headed straight for the bridge, where they ordered the captain to sail toward Somali waters. He refused. A pirate took off the captain’s glasses and slapped him hard across the face, making the demand plain: Comply, Makane testified, or be “physically abused.”

Two days later, the ship was anchored off the Somali coast, where 60 armed pirates boarded. One was Shibin, who picked up a satellite phone and contacted a representative of the shipping company in Germany.

“Hello. I’m calling from the Marida Marguerite,” he said before putting the captain on the line. Makane told his bosses, “They are saying if their demands are not met, they will harass us and they will kill us.”

Taking back the phone, Shibin added: “I myself am not a pirate. I work for a local NGO, a human rights NGO in this area. And I volunteered to do this job because I want to save their lives, and I don’t want these animals to get rid of your crew, okay?”

But to the ship’s crew, it appeared that Shibin was taking orders from the pirates’ commanders.

Over the next few days, Shibin pressed Makane and other crew members about the value of the tanker, its cargo, its food and fuel supplies, and its ability to produce fresh water. He befriended the second officer, who provided valuable information in exchange for privileges. Only then did Shibin make the pirates’ initial demand.

“Immediately following the incident” with the Delta baggage handler, “TSA increased the random and unpredictable screening of aviation workers at various airport access points to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities,” Johnson said in his announcement.

Johnson said he had asked the TSA’s Aviation Security Advisory Committee to review the incidents and recommend remedies. Acting on five of the recommendations that can be implemented quickly, Johnson said that airport and airline employees who are traveling as passengers would no longer be permitted to bypass the scrutiny faced by other passengers. Anyone who boards an airplane other than on-duty pilots and crew will be screened, he said.

Airports will also be required to reduce the number of access points to secure areas and to subject airport workers to random screening throughout each workday, he said, adding that the TSA may send teams in unannounced to do random worker screens.

The E.U. naval force identified the ship as flying the flag of Comoros, a small island nation near Madagascar. Sri Lanka's foreign ministry confirmed that eight of its nationals were on board as crew. The E.U. naval force said pirates were asking for a ransom but the amount was not disclosed. The ship was on its way south to Mogadishu, Somalia's capital.

The attack originated in the Puntland region, which is semiautonomous. “The vessel’s captain reported to the company they were approached by two skiffs and that one of them could see armed personnel on board,” an unidentified Middle East-based official told the Associated Press. “The ship changed course quite soon after that report and is now anchored.”

The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet oversees anti-piracy efforts along Somalia's coast. Concerns about piracy's reemergence in the region have been growing in concurrence with greater exploitation of Somalia's waters by foreigners engaged in illegal fishing. Deprived of a livelihood, some Somali fishermen have turned back to hijacking to get by.

""They put knives on our throats and threatened to kill us if we resist,"" the ship's deputy captain told the Associated Press by cellphone. One crew member broke his leg after trying to flee the pirates, reported the AP.

Luckily, there were no fatalities. The pirates jumped ship with their stolen booty and the tanker had to enlist the help of a passing fishing vessel to figure out its location and call for help.

The incident marked the latest pirate attack near the Malacca Strait, a body of water that links the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, making it perhaps the world's most vital conduit for global shipping. It carries some 40 percent of world trade through its waters every year.

The source spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters.

A Somali pirate, Bile Hussein, said he was aware that pirates had boarded a ship near Yemen’s Socotra island despite resistance from the crew.

Cmdr. Jacqui Sherriff, a spokeswoman for the European Union anti-piracy mission off Somalia, said the mission was coordinating with other authorities to investigate and, if the attack was confirmed, “our thoughts go out to the crew.” The U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet, which oversees regional anti-piracy efforts from Bahrain, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier this month, officials said Somali pirates had seized a small boat and its 11 Indian crew members as the vessel passed through the narrow channel between Socotra and Somalia’s coast.

In March, Somali pirates hijacked a Comoros-flagged oil tanker, marking the first such seizure of a large commercial vessel since 2012. They later released the vessel and its Sri Lankan crew without conditions.

Pirates later seized a fishing trawler, which Somali authorities warned could be used for further piracy.

Piracy off Somalia’s coast was once a serious threat to the global shipping industry.

(The crew has reportedly just been released, but the ship is still detained.)

Iran purports to have seized the vessel to satisfy a debt. As I’ve explained, this argument fails on its own.

The Russian coast guard seized the Arctic Sunrise after two activists attempted to climb onto an oil rig in the Pechora Sea on Sept. 19, and later towed the ship to Murmansk. Greenpeace said the protesters expected to face perhaps 15 days in Russian custody, but investigators charged all of those on board with piracy — which carries a 15-year sentence — and the courts refused to grant bail.

The action made global headlines and has roiled relations between Russia and the Netherlands. The Arctic Sunrise was sailing under a Dutch flag, and the Netherlands protested what it said was an illegal seizure in international waters.

The New York Times on Friday asked, “Does More Security at Airports Make Us Safer or Just Move the Targets?” The article noted that Istanbul’s airport had more layers of protection than U.S. airports, including metal detectors for luggage and passengers as they enter the terminal.

In an interview on NPR’s “Here & Now,” former DHS security adviser Fran Townsend acknowledged that terrorists have demonstrated an ability to modify their tactics whenever new security measures are added. But she also suggested that identifying and engaging with attackers further from an enclosed space makes sense.

1. Southern Philippines — Abu Sayyaf, an Islamic militant group, regularly targets fishing trawlers and slow-moving tugboats. More recently, higher-profile merchant ships have been the focus of attacks, as kidnapping for ransom has proved lucrative and revenue from payments help fund Abu Sayyaf’s efforts directed against the Indonesian government. The militant group, while small, aims to establish an Islamic state in the southern Philippines.

In October, Abu Sayyaf militants hijacked the 400-foot Dongbang Giant 2 as it crossed the Celebes Sea, kidnapping three sailors. Less than a month later, the same group seized the Royal 16, a Vietnamese bulk carrier, and fled with six of the crew.

This group also kidnaps tourists from resorts on land. In August 2016, a ransom of $1 million was paid to the Abu Sayyaf for the release of Norwegian hostage Kjartan Sekkingstad, while $413,000 more won the release of Filipino Marites Flor.

Despite the Philippine government’s efforts to crush Abu Sayyaf, the Jakarta Post reported the group took in more than $7 million in ransom money to free 20 hostages seized during the first half of 2016.

The militant group used these funds to purchase weapons, ammunition and other supplies to counter a renewed Philippine military offensive — and implement an extensive series of bombings, including one detonated in the home town of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.

The Philippine and Indonesian governments announced plans in June to coordinate naval patrols in the Southern Sulu archipelago to curb the maritime threat and cut off Abu Sayyaf‘s coffers.

2. West Africa — Niger Delta militants, frustrated by inequitable resource distribution and environmental degradation from oil extraction, bomb oil pipelines in the Delta and target tankers and supply vessels servicing oil fields and platforms in the Gulf of Guinea. In February 2016, pirates hijacked the oil tanker Leon Dias, severely injuring one crew member. Nigerian pirates, many of whom are associated with the militant group MEND (Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta), boarded 17 other ships and fired upon nine more during 2016, a significant increase in maritime violence in the area.

Here’s how piracy pays off. These rebels appear to target oil tankers filled with refined petroleum, then siphon the fuel for resale on the black market. Since 2010, these attacks have netted the group an estimated $100 million, which helped procure materiel, pay fighters and support local communities.

Oil revenue accounts for as much as 75 percent of Nigeria’s revenue. Counter-piracy operations are also exceedingly costly and attacks against pipelines, production facilities and transports by similar militant groups in the past cut Nigerian oil production by two-thirds. Renewed violence targeting Nigeria’s energy infrastructure also threatens government revenue by reducing maritime traffic in the region.

Details about the vulnerability spread after John Butler, an aviation blogger, drew attention to it in a post late last week. Butler said he had discovered that information stored within the bar codes of boarding passes is unencrypted, and so can be read in advance by technically minded travelers.

Simply by using a smartphone or similar device to check the bar code, travelers could determine whether they would pass through full security screening, or the expedited process.

Some have suggested that the Transportation Security Administration  should explore ways to screen passengers and luggage offsite, perhaps in satellite parking lots or access roads, as it’s done in Israel and some conflict zones, or at least at the entrance to the terminal.
A spokesman for the TSA referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the TSA. The DHS, through a spokesman, wouldn’t discuss whether the agencies were considering additional screening before passengers enter terminals other than to say that the “DHS and our partners routinely adapt both seen and unseen security measures in order to counter evolving threats.” DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson on Thursday told a Senate panel that DHS has enhanced security at the nation’s airports since the Belgium attack.

As the passengers who arrived from Ethiopia passed from the screening area at Dulles International Airport on Thursday, a flock of friends and relatives waited to welcome them with cameras poised.

It appeared to be business as usual at Dulles, but behind the scenes federal officials promised that extra precautions against the potential spread of the Ebola virus were underway.
The enhanced screening that was expected to begin Thursday at Dulles and three other international gateway airports — Chicago’s O’Hare International, Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International and Newark Liberty International — is intended to single out travelers from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in West Africa.
Under the enhanced screening guidelines, travelers from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are singled out by officers from CBP for examination and asked to fill out an Ebola-specific questionnaire. They will have their temperatures taken — fever is a symptom of the virus — and be taken to an isolation room if the temperature is higher than 100.4 degrees.

Passengers whose travel began in other nations, including those in Africa, are not required to go through the process unless they show obvious signs of illness.
Dulles Airport Manager Chris Browne said that airport officials along with their partner agencies held a four-hour walk-through of how the enhanced screening process would unfold. Browne said they also consulted with their counterparts at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, where screenings began last weekend.

He said airport officials have installed additional hand-sanitizing stations around the terminals and issued gloves to personnel — including mobile lounge drivers and airport ambassadors — who might come in contact with passengers arriving from the impacted countries. But Browne was careful to note that the majority of airport workers were unlikely to have any contact with passengers arriving from those countries.

All departing passengers pass through a series of security procedures before embarking their plane. One such procedure is a short, scripted interview when security personnel must make decisions about passenger risk by looking for behavioral indicators of deception.

These are referred to as “suspicious signs”: signs of nervousness, aggression and an unusual interest in security procedures, for example. However, this approach has never been empirically validated and its continued use is criticized for being based on outdated, unreliable perceptions of how people behave when being deceptive.

Some security measure are completely broken

First we trained 97 security officers to use CCE. Once trained, these officers began to screen real passengers using CCE, working alongside colleagues who were using the suspicious signs method. All security agents were fitted with discreet microphones to record screening interviews.

Across the duration of the study, 204 fake passengers, embedded within the normal traveling passenger population, passed through both the CCE and suspicious signs screening procedures. One week before participation, mock passengers received a valid ticket, an itinerary of flights, a deceptive cover story – and a ticketing record was created on the airline electronic database.
Our research shows that current screening methods are not fit for the purpose. Methods that use verbal content, such as CCE, present a much better alternative. Investment in suspicious signs approaches is money wasted.

The Transportation Security Administration program, which launched in October 2011, rewards so-called trusted travelers with relaxed procedures reminiscent of the pre-9/11 days. The agents flip the usual script: They remind passengers to keep on clothing items that they would shed at traditional security outposts and instruct them to leave laptops and compliant liquids in their carry-on bags. Travelers also walk through old-fashioned metal detectors, not the newfangled body-image scanners. 
Since its introduction, more than 20 million passengers have used PreCheck nationwide, according to the TSA. At Washington Dulles, about 5,000 of the daily 25,000 passengers walk the line. The program is rapidly expanding, with more than 100 airports participating, up from 40 earlier this year, in 42 states and two territories (Puerto Rico and Guam). Nine U.S. airlines, including Southwest and JetBlue, two recent additions, are involved.

A plane carrying Transportation Security Administration head Peter Neffenger was nosing up to an arrival gate in Brussels on March 22 when the first of two bombs that killed 16 people exploded in the terminal. A third went off a short time later in a subway, also killing 16.

“Here’s what we do to make sure that that doesn’t happen here,” said Neffenger, who was arriving in Belgium for a security meeting when the bombs went off. “There’s a lot more patrolling of public areas here than I believe was the case in Brussels. We have explosive-sniffing dogs moving through the fronts of the big airports. And there’s a lot of attention paid to people moving big items through airports.”
“There’s some things you have to do after Brussels, and one of them is to realize that public areas of the world are vulnerable, by definition,” Neffenger said Friday. “It helps that we have a vast national intelligence network. I’m comfortable that in the United States, in particular, we are doing about as much as we can do to track, to identify and to pay attention to people of concern. If you’ve made a reservation, your name is automatically bounced against databases.”


TSA has 320 trained dogs, and local law enforcement agencies have committed almost 700 more to patrol airports. Most are trained to detect bombs in checked luggage. Neffenger is having all of the TSA dogs cross-trained so they can work passenger lines.

“They are the ones that are designed to walk up and down a security line and detect for explosive vapor wake, and then they trace it back to its source,” he said.

“I certainly want to see dogs in all the major airports. I think we could put 500 [dog] teams to use.”

Wiedefeld said in an interview that the fire was caused by an electrical malfunction involving power lines called “jumper cables.”
In that sense, the incident seemed to echo the deadly calamity on Jan. 12, 2015, near Metro’s L’Enfant Plaza station. An electrical malfunction on tracks near the station that day filled a tunnel with smoke, engulfing a stalled Yellow Line train in fumes. Scores of passengers were sickened and one died of respiratory failure.

In many places in the subway, for various reasons, there are gaps in the electrified third rails. Jumper cables bridge the gaps almost like extension cords, allowing current to continue flowing along the third rails, from which trains draw power.
Monday’s fire also occurred in a third-rail gap that was bridged by jumper cables, Wiedefeld said. “Basically, the older cables, where they connect to the third rail, something happened — a short circuit; I don’t know what the official term is — and it caused the condition of the flare-up, which caused the fire in the actual cables.”

The “short circuit,” as he called it, could trigger electrical “arcing,” which was the cause of the L’Enfant fire, the NTSB has said.

A preliminary safety board report cited “severe electrical arcing damage” to the jumper cables at the L’Enfant site. Arcing suggests that the fire there resulted from electricity escaping from one or more of the cables. This could occur if the cable insulation was damaged, exposing the current to moisture or other contaminants, which could provide a path for the electricity to flow out of its containment.

That could generate tremendous heat, causing smoke-producing fire or melting.",BASE,187.0326690673828,68.7488420009613,118.12392807006836,363,741,186.87277007102966

A storm is on the horizon, projected to hit the Florida Panhandle late Thursday or early Friday. Forecasters predicted that Tropical Storm Hermine would only gush rain, but they recently elevated it to hurricane status. Floridians have many reasons to worry. The sea level is rising faster than first predicted, and analysts who assess potential property damage say that contributes to Florida being more vulnerable to massive losses than any other state.
Hermine lacks the power to cause a worst-case scenario like hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, but even as a Category 1 storm, it will serve as a reminder of what could be. Mere nuisance flooding already causes drainage systems to bubble over in the Miami area, and strong winds can roil Tampa Bay until it’s level with sea walls that guard roads and homes.
In extreme cases 2.5 million homes could be seriously damaged which would cost more than $200 billion to fix according to experts.

Top hurricane expert says that climate change is influencing the storms, like tropical cyclone Pam which has caused major distruction and damage and loss of life on Vanautu. 
Ocean surface temperature is often the first connection that comes to mind when considering how global warming could impact tropical cyclones say the experts. 
Meteorologist Kerry Emanuel dug into past ocean and atmospheric temperature and found that potential intensity has been increasing in the region where Tropical Cyclone Pam formed. He found about a 5.5-mile-per-hour increase in potential intensity per decade in the region — meaning that with every passing decade, the upper limit on how intense tropical cyclones can become has increased by over 5 mph.
Without enough yearly cyclone data in the South Pacific, Emanuel turned to eight climate models to calculate future trends in potential intensity through the year 2100. “Of these, two models showed insignificant trends in the region in which Pam developed, and the rest showed positive trends averaging around [1.1 mph] per decade, considerably less than the observed trend over the last 30 years.”
Emanuel’s results are consistent with what we think we know about hurricanes and global warming, and the ever-growing consensus that there is, in fact, a relationship

TSA has 320 trained dogs, and local law enforcement agencies have committed almost 700 more to patrol airports. Most are trained to detect bombs in checked luggage. Neffenger is having all of the TSA dogs cross-trained so they can work passenger lines.

Pirates of unknown nationality had seized the ship Oct. 2 and kept its crew hostage while they siphoned a third of its cargo: some 2,000 metric tons of oil. ""They put knives on our throats and threatened to kill us if we resist,"" the ship's deputy captain told the Associated Press by cellphone. One crew member broke his leg after trying to flee the pirates, reported the AP.

Let us count the indignities:

• The wait to get to the metal detector itself can take anywhere from five minutes to an hour. You have basically no idea how long.

• If you're silly enough to have brought along more than 3 ounces of toothpaste, shampoo, liquor, water or some other liquid on your flight, you're going to have to either toss it or start the whole process over again. If, say, a friend or family member gives you a bottle of bourbon that consequently has sentimental value, you're going to have to pay $29 or whatever to check your bag or else watch a TSA inspector pour out the memories before your very eyes.

• At the end of the security line wait, you have to take off your shoes, jacket and belt, empty your pockets, pull your laptop and/or liquids (3 ounces or less!) out of your carry-on bag, and arrange all those into separate bins (one for the laptop alone, of course!). I usually expedite this process while waiting in line -- taking off my belt and emptying my pockets and putting the contents into my carry-on bag, taking out my laptop and holding it separately, and unlacing my shoes, though on at least one occasion this has ended with me tripping on my shoelaces, with hijinks ensuing.

• Once you've managed all that, you get to go through a metal detector or, better yet, a body scanner -- for looking under your clothes. While the infamously invasive Rapiscan scanner was phased out over inadequate privacy protections, body scanners generally aren't going anywhere.

• Usually that's it, but sometimes you're randomly selected for a pat-down. And if they find something they don't like in your luggage or on your person, you could get even more than that. Hooray!

• Once that's all done and you've stumbled from the end of security to the nearest bench, you get to put your belt, shoes and jacket back on, refill your pockets, and put your laptop and liquids back in your carry-on. Now you just have to wait because you, like a responsible traveler, allotted a fair amount of time in case security took a while.",BASE,81.56334805488586,24.192868947982788,57.04558801651001,341,709,81.2384569644928

Tragedy could have been averted had the transit system managed to reverse a single train, filled with some 380 gasping, choking, desperate passengers, out of the smoke-filled tunnel. It failed.

The system was so lacking in competence and preparation that it thwarted even those employees who tried to respond with common sense. That’s the unpleasant but unavoidable conclusion to be drawn from the first of two days of hearings, convened this week by the National Transportation Safety Board, on the fatal smoke incident.

The litany of failures, systemic and individual, is extensive and appalling. It saps public confidence in Metro and its leaders’ insistence that they have nurtured a culture of safety at the agency.

The botched calls started with the failure of controllers at Metro’s command center to halt trains in the vicinity of the L’Enfant Plaza station even after the tunnel just south of the station began filling with smoke from a track’s electrical mishap. After that, the fiasco unfolded as a chain reaction, as a second train pulled into the station, blocking the first from backing out of the tunnel.

As it happens, there was just enough room at the south end of the L’Enfant Plaza platform for the tunnel-trapped train to edge its first car back into the station, which would have enabled evacuation. But Metro didn’t know that: Its computer system is unable to pinpoint a train’s precise position along a platform.

The result was paralysis, panic and, in the case of one passenger, death. The lead train’s operator, aware his passengers were choking, coughing and vomiting, pleaded for help from Metro’s command center. The response he got was useless: “Stand by. Stand by.”

The storm has sustained winds of 45 mph, but it looks ragged and disorganized.

Since the beginning of the reliable weather satellite era in 1966, only six other years have had six named storms so early in the season, including the hyperactive seasons of 1995 and 2005.  Of course, there is legitimate debate as to whether Alex back in January should be bundled up with  he 2016 calendar year, which is what officially counts, or the end of the 2015 season.

The environment around Fiona still favors additional strengthening for another day or so, but then conditions turn more hostile. The official intensity forecast from the National Hurricane Center reflects this, and it keeps Fiona as a minimal tropical storm Sunday through Tuesday as it continues its trek to the northwest, following a weakness in the subtropical ridge.

Consistent with what I noted yesterday, model track forecasts vary, but in a logical way.  The models (see below) that keep the storm weaker also allow it to stay further south and west, while models that have it as a stronger storm are much quicker to turn it to the north.  The National Hurricane Center’s track (labeled “OFCI”) essentially splits the difference.

Not all tracks shown here should be treated as equals. Some are very basic models, some are very sophisticated, and some just show a consensus of combinations of models already on here.

History strongly favors storms like this to turn to the north well before reaching the United States. The map below shows the tracks of all 22 tropical storms that passed within 100 miles of Fiona’s current position during August since 1851. The only storm that didn’t quite make the turn in time to remain safely out at sea was a Category 2 hurricane that hit North Carolina’s Outer Banks in 1933.",BASE_WAPO,14.508939027786257,11.34025502204895,2.9744789600372314,408,713,14.314733982086182

Last week, in its first substantial disclosures about the Jan. 12 incident, the National Transportation Safety Board said the tunnel calamity, near the L’Enfant Plaza station, was exacerbated by Metro’s inability to quickly identify the origin point of the smoke. Metro then activated two sets of tunnel ventilation fans at cross-purposes, pulling the smoke toward the train instead of pushing it away, the NTSB said.

Metro has been aware for months that its Landover train controllers are not adequately served by computer software that dates to 2002, even with modifications made in the past decade, the documents show.
The origin of the crisis was a malfunction involving a bundle of power cables attached to the electrified third rail in the tunnel, the NTSB has said.

Tropical storm Polo is expected to pass to its southwest, likely making its closest approach midday Saturday.

The center of the storm – with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph – is predicted to remain offshore, but its outer bands could still lash heavily-damaged Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo with rain showers and gusty winds.

A tropical storm watch is in effect for the region and the National Hurricane Center cautions the watch may be upgraded to a warning. It says the region should prepare for tropical storm-force winds, 4 to 8 inches of rain, and life-threatening surf and rip currents.

Polo attained hurricane status Wednesday evening but began a slow weakening trend today, that is expected to continue. In three to four days, the storm is forecast to dissipate over the open water of the Pacific.

Although the worst of Polo is expected to remain offshore, any wind and rain is likely to disrupt the clean-up effort in this storm-ravaged region.

After Matthew makes its closest approach to the Carolinas, it may hug the Mid-Atlantic coast or turn more out to sea over the weekend.

More recently, higher-profile merchant ships have been the focus of attacks, as kidnapping for ransom has proved lucrative and revenue from payments help fund Abu Sayyaf’s efforts directed against the Indonesian government. The militant group, while small, aims to establish an Islamic state in the southern Philippines.

In October, Abu Sayyaf militants hijacked the 400-foot Dongbang Giant 2 as it crossed the Celebes Sea, kidnapping three sailors. Less than a month later, the same group seized the Royal 16, a Vietnamese bulk carrier, and fled with six of the crew.
